# Replace the Thermal Conductive Paste for reComputer

## Introduction

Thermal paste is a critical material for ensuring efficient heat transfer between the Jetson module and its heatsink. Over time, the paste may dry out, degrade, or lose effectiveness, leading to increased device temperatures and even performance throttling. Regularly replacing the thermal paste can significantly improve cooling performance and extend the hardware's lifespan. Using the [reComputer Super J3011](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-Super-J3011-p-6444.html) as an example, this article will provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how to properly replace the thermal paste.

## Prerequisites

* Thermal paste
* High-purity isopropyl alcohol (90%+ concentration, for cleaning)
* Lint-free cloth/cleaning wipes
* Screwdriver
* Plastic spreader (for applying thermal paste)

## Getting Started

**Step 1:** Loosen the four screws at the top of the reComputer.  
**Step 2:** Slowly detach the heatsink.  
**Step 3:** Clean off the old thermal paste.  
**Step 4:** Spread a fresh layer of new thermal paste.  
**Step 5:** Reattach the heatsink and fasten the screws to secure it in place.
