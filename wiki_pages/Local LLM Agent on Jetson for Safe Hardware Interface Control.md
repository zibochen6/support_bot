# Jetson LLM Interface Controller

![enter image description here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1030x616.png)

Welcome, maker, dreamer, and builder. This isn't just another home automation project—it's the bridge between human thought and embedded action. By combining the raw computational power of an **NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX** with the reasoning capabilities of a local Large Language Model, you're creating an intelligent nervous system for your home, lab, or creative space.

Imagine whispering *“make the room feel like a cozy café”* and watching lights dim, soft music begin, and the thermostat adjust—all orchestrated by an AI that truly *understands* your intent. Or picture a safety-conscious agent monitoring a baby’s room via camera, describing the scene, and alerting you at the first sign of danger.

This repository is your launchpad. It demonstrates how natural language—whether typed or spoken—can be transformed into precise hardware commands, executed in real time on the edge. The LLM acts as a **“neural compiler”**—translating fuzzy human requests into structured, executable JSON that your Jetson can act upon.

In this wiki I am going to write a starting point to create your own home assistant agent based on recomputer Nvidia Jetson Orin nx. This project uses Jetson interfaces to control the environment and you will be hands on interfaces and mixing them with an LLM agent to convert the user prompt to command due to Jetson know what to do. In other world the LLM is like a mapping from user text or voice (if you want you can add STT and TTS easily to the project) to a command that is understandable to Jetson and your coding home controller. Even you can expand this project and add some more interesting things like VLM. For example you can add a camera and try to describe the baby room and if a danger occur the agent gives a feed back or a call to your mobile.

You can see the code in [THIS](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll) link.

## ✨ What This Project Brings to Life

* **🧠 Intelligent Command Parsing**
  A local LLM (like Llama, Mistral, or another model running on your Jetson) is carefully prompted to map free-form text to structured commands. The prompt engineering is captured in [`models/jetson-controller.txt`](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll/blob/master/models/jetson-controller.txt) a blueprint for teaching the model your domain.
* **🌐 Minimalist, Robust API**
  A clean FastAPI endpoint ([`app/main.py`](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll/blob/master/app/main.py)) accepts user requests and orchestrates the entire pipeline—parsing, validation, and execution—with elegance and speed.
* **⚡ Hardware Abstraction Layer**
  Dive into [`app/hardware_controller.py`](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll/blob/master/app/hardware_controller.py) to find routines for GPIO, PWM, I2C, and more. This is where software pulses become physical actions: lights brighten, motors spin, sensors read.
* **🔗 LLM Agent Integration**
  The [`app/llm_agent.py`](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll/blob/master/app/llm_agent.py) module is a thin, adaptable wrapper that communicates with your local model server. Swap models, tweak parameters, or even change APIs without breaking the flow.
* **📦 Structured Output Parser**
  Reliably extract JSON from the model’s response with [`app/command_parser.py`](https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/llm_interface_controll/blob/master/app/command_parser.py). It ensures that even creative LLM outputs become predictable, actionable commands.

## 🌌 Philosophy & Vision

This project is built on a simple, powerful idea: **your words should control your world.**
By running an LLM locally on the Jetson, we ensure privacy, low latency, and endless customization. The system is deliberately modular—each component is a puzzle piece you can replace, upgrade, or reimagine.

Think of it as:

* A **translator** between human intuition and machine precision.
* A **scaffold** for building context-aware environments.
* A **playground** for experimenting with AI on the edge.

---

## 🧬 The Command Language: JSON Schema

The LLM is trained to respond with a consistent JSON structure—a contract between the AI’s understanding and the hardware’s capabilities.

```
{  
  "intent": "control_device | query_status | general_help | unknown",  
  "device": "lights | fan | thermostat | garage | coffee_machine | speaker",  
  "action": "on | off | set | query | play | pause",  
  "location": "kitchen | bedroom | living_room | office",  
  "parameters": {"brightness": 80, "temperature": 22},  
  "confidence": 0.95  
}
```

Every field tells a story:

* **intent** — The high-level goal of the request.
* **device & action** — The target hardware and the operation to perform.
* **location** — Spatial context for multi-room or multi-zone setups.
* **parameters** — Fine-grained control (dim levels, exact temperatures, speeds, etc.).
* **confidence** — The model’s self-assessed certainty, used to gate risky or ambiguous actions.

The full prompt—including schema examples and tone guidance—lives in:

```
models/jetson-controller.txt
```

## ⚙️ Architecture: How the Magic Flows

### Step-by-Step Journey

1. **The Invocation**  
   A `POST` request arrives at `/command`, carrying natural language.
2. **The Dialogue**  
   The parser consults the LLM via `ask_llm()` to interpret the request.
3. **The Reasoning**  
   A local model (for example, a 7B parameter variant) processes the prompt and returns structured JSON.
4. **The Extraction**  
   The parser validates, cleans, and normalizes the JSON, ensuring it matches the expected schema.
5. **The Execution**  
   `execute()` dispatches the command to the appropriate hardware handler:

   * **Lights** → GPIO pins, PWM for dimming
   * **Fan** → GPIO or PWM for speed control
   * **Thermostat** → I2C communication with temperature sensors
   * **Speaker** → `amixer` subprocess calls for volume and playback
6. **The Feedback Loop**  
   The system returns a success or failure message, closing the interaction.

### Configuring Your LLM

Edit `app/llm_agent.py` to point to your model server. Ensure the model label matches the one defined in your prompt file.

---

## `jetson-controller.txt`

### 🧠 Purpose & Role

`jetson-controller.txt` is the **core system prompt** that defines the behavior of the Local Language Model (LLM) used in the Jetson LLM Interface Controller project.

It acts as a **contract** between natural language and hardware execution.

Its responsibilities are to:

* Interpret user natural-language commands
* Constrain the LLM into **predictable, machine-safe behavior**
* Emit **strictly structured JSON** suitable for deterministic execution
* Prevent unsafe, off-topic, or hallucinated actions

In short:

> This file is the brain that turns human intent into reliable edge-device control.

---

### 🧱 Base Model Declaration

```
FROM llama3.2:1b
```

This line specifies the **foundation model** used by the system. You may substitute it with other supported models, such as:

* Mistral
* LLaMA 3.x
* Qwen2
* Any Ollama / llama.cpp / TensorRT-LLM compatible model

The prompt is designed to be **model-agnostic**, focusing on behavior rather than architecture.

---

### 🎭 System Identity

```
You are HomeAssistantAI...
```

The model is explicitly assigned a **role and identity**:

* A home-automation interpreter
* Not a chatbot
* Not a general assistant
* Not a creative writer

This sharply narrows the model’s behavior and reduces hallucinations.

---

### 🎯 Goals of the Prompt

The goals section defines the **mission constraints** of the model:

1. Understand smart-home-related natural language
2. Convert it into structured JSON
3. Reject unsafe, irrelevant, or impossible requests
4. Output **only valid JSON**, nothing more

This ensures:

* Deterministic downstream parsing
* No post-processing hacks
* No ambiguity between “thinking” and “acting”

---

### 📦 JSON Output Schema

The heart of the file is the **command schema**:

```
{  
  "intent": "...",  
  "device": "...",  
  "action": "...",  
  "location": "...",  
  "parameters": { ... },  
  "confidence": 0.0  
}
```

#### Why This Matters

* It creates a **stable API** between the LLM and hardware code
* It enables schema validation (Pydantic / JSON Schema)
* It allows safe rejection based on confidence

---

### 🧩 Field-by-Field Breakdown

#### `intent`

Defines **what kind of request** the user made:

* `control_device` — Execute a physical action
* `query_status` — Read sensor or device state
* `general_help` — Usage or system questions
* `unknown` — Anything unsafe, off-topic, or unclear

This field is the **primary router** in the backend logic.

---

#### `device`

Represents the **target hardware abstraction**, not the physical driver.

Examples:

* `lights`
* `thermostat`
* `fan`
* `speaker`
* `garage`

If no device is applicable, it must be `null`.

This prevents the LLM from inventing hardware.

---

#### `action`

Describes **what to do** with the device:

* `turn_on`, `turn_off`
* `set`, `increase`, `decrease`
* `open`, `close`, `lock`, `unlock`

If the action is unclear or missing, `null` is required.

---

#### `location`

Provides **spatial context**, enabling multi-room setups:

* `living_room`
* `kitchen`
* `bedroom`
* `garage`

If not mentioned explicitly, this must be `null`.

---

#### `parameters`

Carries **fine-grained control data**, such as:

* Temperature values
* Brightness percentages
* Volume levels
* Modes or presets

May be:

* An object (`{ "temperature": 22 }`)
* `{}`
* `null` when unspecified

---

#### `confidence`

A floating-point value between `0.0` and `1.0` representing the model’s **self-assessed certainty**.

This enables:

* Confidence gating
* Safety thresholds
* Human-in-the-loop validation

Example usage:

```
if command.confidence < 0.5:  
    reject()
```

---

### 🛡️ Behavior Rules & Safety Constraints

The behavior rules section is **critical for safe deployment**.

Key protections include:

* ❌ No natural language outside JSON
* ❌ No creative, political, or unrelated content
* ❌ No hallucinated devices
* ❌ No execution of ambiguous commands with high confidence

Off-topic requests are forcefully mapped to:

```
{  
  "intent": "unknown",  
  "confidence": 0.0  
}
```

This ensures the system **fails closed**, not open.

---

### 🔀 Ambiguity Handling

When a request is *possibly* home-related but unclear:

* The model must choose the closest reasonable interpretation
* Confidence must be **low** (e.g., 0.3–0.5)

Example:

> “It’s too dark here”

→ Possibly turn on lights, but never with high certainty.

---

### 🧮 Multi-Command Limitation

If the user issues **multiple commands in one sentence**:

* Only **one command** is allowed in the output
* Priority goes to the most important or the first mentioned

This keeps execution simple and avoids partial failures.

---

### 🧪 Examples Section

The examples act as **few-shot training** for the model.

They demonstrate:

* Correct schema usage
* Proper confidence levels
* Safe handling of invalid requests

Examples include:

* Turning on lights
* Setting thermostat values
* Querying sensors
* Rejecting creative or unrelated prompts

These examples are essential for **model alignment and consistency**.

---

### 🧠 Why This File Is So Important

`jetson-controller.txt` is not just a prompt — it is:

* A **safety policy**
* A **command language specification**
* A **hardware protection layer**
* A **deterministic interface** between AI and the physical world

Any changes to this file directly affect:

* System safety
* Execution correctness
* User trust

---

## 🎬 Bringing It to Life: Examples

```
# Run the uvicorn  
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Example 1: Setting the Mood

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/command \  
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
  -d '{"text": "Dim the kitchen lights to 30% and play jazz"}'
```

**The Flow Unfolded:**

* The API receives the poetic request.
* The LLM parses it into two commands (lights + speaker).
* The executor adjusts PWM on the light circuit and triggers a playlist.
* The room transforms.

---

### Example 2: Inquisitive Agent

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/command \  
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
  -d '{"text": "What’s the temperature in the bedroom?"}'
```

**Behind the Scenes:**

* **Intent:** `query_status`
* **Device:** thermostat
* **Action:** query
* I2C reads the sensor and returns a friendly response (spoken, if TTS is added).

## ⚠️ Safety & Responsible Creation

### Hardware Safety

* **Isolation During Development** — Mock GPIO and I2C when coding off-device
* **Current & Voltage Limits** — Use proper drivers and relays for high-power loads
* **Failsafes** — Default to safe states (lights off, motors stopped)

### AI Safety

* **Confidence Gating** — Commands with confidence < 0.5 are rejected (configurable)
* **Intent Filtering** — Off-topic or dangerous requests return `unknown`
* **Authentication** — Add API keys or OAuth in production environments

---

### Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests** — Mock `ask_llm()` and validate hardware logic
* **Integration Tests** — Start with low-power peripherals
* **Logging** — Trace every stage of the pipeline for transparency

---

## 🛠️ For the Developer: Pro Tips

* Emulate hardware with a `fake_gpio.py` module
* Use structured logging (`structlog`) for end-to-end traceability
* Add `/health` endpoints for system and model checks
