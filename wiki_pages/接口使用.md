}  
  
void loop() {  
  delay(100);  
}  
  
void receiveEvent(int howMany) {  
  // Callback when receiving host data  
  while (Wire.available()) {  
    char c = Wire.read();  
    // Data received can be processed here.  
  }  
}  
  
void requestEvent() {  
  // Callback when the host requests data  
  Wire.write("A"); // Return a byte of data  
}
```

**步骤 4.** Jetson 安装 IIC 测试工具。

### 使用 SGxxx 系列摄像头

**步骤 1.** 设置帧同步模式（默认未启用！）。

info

这里我们演示如何配置不同型号和分辨率的摄像头。

```
#enables frame synchronization  
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=trig_mode=1  
#Set the frame rate of the camera  
v4l2-ctl -V --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1536 -c sensor_mode=0 --stream-mmap -d /dev/video0  
#Set the camera format  
v4l2-ctl -V --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1536 -c sensor_mode=0 -d /dev/video0
```

note

`trig_mode = 1` 启用帧同步，而 `trig_mode = 0` 禁用帧同步。默认设置是禁用帧同步。

`--set-fmt-video` 后跟根据连接的摄像头选择的分辨率。目前有三个 sensor\_mode 选项，每个对应不同的分辨率。

* sensor\_mode=0 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/1920x1536
* sensor\_mode=1 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/1920x1080
* sensor\_mode=2 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/3840x2160

**步骤 2.** 启动摄像头。
