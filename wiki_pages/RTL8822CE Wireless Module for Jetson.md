## Hardware Connection

danger

In this wiki, we will use the reComputer J4012 as an example to demonstrate how to install and configure a RTL8822CE wireless module on Jetson device.

Step1. Prepare all materials that will be used.

* reComputer J4012 equipped with Jetpack 5.1.2
* Infineon Wi-Fi Module

Step 2. Insert the wireless module into the M.2 Key E port.
