# Deploy Live VLM WebUI on reComputer Jetson

## Introduction

Live VLM WebUI is a universal web interface for real-time Vision Language Model interaction and benchmarking. It can stream your webcam to any VLM and get live AI-powered analysis - perfect for testing models, benchmarking performance, and exploring vision AI capabilities across multiple domains and hardware platforms.

This wiki will show you how to deploy Live VLM WebUI on the reComputer Super J4012.

## Prerequisites

* reComputer Super J4012
* USB Camera

info

Please ensure that your Jetson device has the Jetpack 6.2 operating system installed.

info

Before configuring the software, please connect the USB camera to the Type-A port of the reComputer Super J4012.

## Deploy Live VLM WebUI

Step1. Install and run ollama in reComputer Jetson.

Run the following command in the terminal window on reComputer Jetson.

```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  
ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b
```

note

The model download will take approximately 10 minutes. Please wait patiently.

Step2. Install the Live VLM WebUI.

Run the following command in the terminal window on reComputer Jetson.

```
# Install dependencies  
sudo apt install openssl python3-pip  
  
# Install the package  
python3 -m pip install --user live-vlm-webui  
  
# Add to PATH (one-time setup)  
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  
source ~/.bashrc  
  
# Run it  
live-vlm-webui
```

Step3.Configure and launch Live VLM WebUI.

If the application runs successfully, you can open the WebUI by entering `https://localhost:8090` in the browser.

* In VLM API Configuration, select the `ollama` inference engine and the `llama3.2-vision` model you just downloaded.
* In Camera and App Control, select `USB Camera`.
* After clicking the Run button, you can wait for the inference results from the backend.

## Effect Demonstration

The entire workflow can run normally on a reComputer Super J4012 device with 16GB of memory. However, during actual testing, it was found that the inference speed is very slow.
