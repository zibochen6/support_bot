## Introduction

reComputer series for Jetson are compact edge computers built with NVIDIA advanced AI embedded systems: J10 (Jetson Nano 4GB) and J20 (Jetson [Xavier NX](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NVIDIA-Jetson-Xavier-NX-Module-p-4421.html?queryID=fa33abfaf6f67f95a4c01b60263d2793&objectID=4421&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products) 8GB and Jetson Xavier 16GB). With rich extension modules, industrial peripherals, and thermal management, reComputer for Jetson is ready to help you accelerate and scale the next-gen AI product by deploying popular DNN models and ML frameworks to the edge and inferencing with high performance.

reComputer J1020 v2 is a powerful and compact intelligent edge box built with Jetson Nano production module, bringing modern AI performance to the edge. The built-in J202 carrier board is the same dimension as the Jetson Nano Developer Kit, including 4xUSB 3, M.2 Key M, HDMI, and DP. The full system also includes a fan and a power adapter.

For AI beginners, if you would like to get critical AI skills and dive into deep learning. [NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute (DLI)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/) delivers practical, hands-on training and certification. Please also check out Seeed [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_Jetson_Series_Started_Guide/) guide including getting started with Jetson Nano and also building different projects.

For solution providers, reComputer J1020 v2 is preinstalled with Jetpack 4.6.1, with a rich set of I/Os, this AI box simplifies development and fits for deployment for edge AI solution providers working in video analytics, object detection, natural language processing, medical imaging, and robotics across industries of smart cities, security, industrial automation, smart factories.
