note

If you want to change further settings of the camera, you can update the arguments such as **width, height, framerate, format**, etc.

## RTC

RTC stands for Real-Time Clock. It is a clock that keeps track of the current time and date independently of the main system clock. RTCs are commonly used in computers, embedded systems, and other electronic devices to maintain accurate timekeeping even when the device is powered off. They are often powered by a small battery to ensure continuous operation and retain time and date information during power cycles.

### Connection Overview

* Method 1* Method 2

Connect a **3V CR1220 coin cell battery** to the RTC socket on the board as shown below. Make sure the **positive (+)** end of the battery is facing upwards.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-connect-coin-cell-back.gif)

Connect a **3V CR2302 coin cell battery with JST connector** to the 2-pin 1.25mm JST socket on the board as shown below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-connect-coin-cell.gif)

### Usage

* **Step 1:** Connect an RTC battery as mentioned above.
* **Step 2:** Turn on reComputer Industrial.
* **Step 3:** On the Ubuntu Desktop, click the drop-down menu at the top right corner, navigate to `Settings > Date & Time`, connect to a network via an Ethernet cable and select **Automatic Date & Time** to obtain the date/ time automatically.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Industrial/13.png)

note

If you have not connected to internet via Ethernet, you can manually set the date/time here.

* **Step 4:** Open a terminal window, and execute the below command to check the hardware clock time.

```
sudo hwclock
```

You will see the output something like below which is not the correct date/time.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-RTC.png)

* **Step 5:** Change the hardware clock time to the current system clock time by entering the below command.

```
sudo hwclock --systohc
```

* **Step 6:** Remove any Ethernet cables connected to make sure it will not grab the time from the internet and reboot the board.

```
sudo reboot
```

* **Step 7:** Check hardware clock time to verify that the date/ time stays the same eventhough the device was powered off.
* **Step 8:** Create a new shell script using any text editor of your preference. Here we use **vi** text editor.

```
sudo vi /usr/bin/hwtosys.sh
```

* **Step 9:** Enter **insert mode** by pressing **i**, copy and paste the following content inside the file.

```
#!/bin/bash  
  
sudo hwclock --hctosys
```

* **Step 10:** Make the script executable.

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/hwtosys.sh
```

* **Step 11:** Create a systemd file.

```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/hwtosys.service
```

* **Step 12:** Add the following inside the file.

```
[Unit]  
Description=Change system clock from hardware clock  
  
[Service]  
ExecStart=/usr/bin/hwtosys.sh  
  
[Install]  
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* **Step 13:** Reload systemctl daemon.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

* **Step 14:** Enable the newly created service to start on boot and start the service.

```
sudo systemctl enable hwtosys.service  
sudo systemctl start hwtosys.service
```

* **Step 15:** Verify the script is up and running as a systemd service.

```
sudo systemctl status hwtosys.service
```

* **Step 16:** Reboot the board and you will the system clock is now in sync with the hardware clock.

## Fan control

nvfancontrol is a userspace fan speed control daemon. This manages the fan speed based on the temperature-to-fan-speed mapping table in the nvfancontrol configuration file.

There are some basic elements in the nvfancontrol service, including Tmargin, kickstart PWM, fan profile, fan control, and fan governor. All of these can be programmed via the configuration file based on the user’s preferences. This chapter will explain each of them in the following sections.

note

If you want to change nvfancontrol.conf make sure you have read [it](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.4.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/PlatformPowerAndPerformance/JetsonOrinNanoSeriesJetsonOrinNxSeriesAndJetsonAgxOrinSeries.html?highlight=fan#fan-profile-control)

### Usage

* Method 1* Method 2

* **Step 1:** Stop the nvfancontrol systemd service.

```
sudo systemctl stop nvfancontrol
```

* **Step 2:** Change nvfancontrol.conf.

```
vi /etc/nvfancontrol.conf
```

note

After you change nvfancontrol.conf, print `Ese` and `:q` to quit

* **Step 3:** Remove the status file.

```
sudo rm /var/lib/nvfancontrol/status
```

* **Step 4:** Restart nvfancontrol systemd service.

```
sudo systemctl restart nvfancontrol
```

* **Step 1:** Enter root model.

```
sudo -i
```

* **Step 2:** Stop the nvfancontrol systemd service.

```
sudo systemctl stop nvfancontrol
```

* **Step 3:** Change PWM value.

```
echo 100 > /sys/devices/platform/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon3/pwm1
```

note

The larger of value, the faster of fan speed. PWM value should between 0 to 255, maybe **hwmon3** is not your pathword so check your own pathword

* **Step 4:** Check rpm.

```
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/rpm
```

### UART

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a communication protocol used for serial communication between two devices. UART communication involves two pins: one for transmitting data (TX) and one for receiving data (RX). It is asynchronous, meaning that data is transmitted without a shared clock signal between the devices. UART is commonly used in various applications such as microcontrollers, sensors, and communication between different electronic devices.

#### Connection Overview

The UART interface is using the pin below, or you can use another UART interface on J401:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

#### Usage

* **Step 1:** Install [PuTTy](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) on your windows laptop, and set PuTTy as below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-windows-uart-set.png)

* **Step 2:** Install PuTTy on Jetson, open your terminal(ALT+Ctrl+T) and type the following command.

```
sudo apt install putty
```

* **Step 3:** Use PuTTy on Windows send 'hello linux' to Jetson, and use PuTTy on Jetson send 'hello windows' to windwos.

note

Make sure your baudrate have be set 115200.

The result is as below:

### I2C

I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit. It is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables communication between multiple integrated circuits in a system. I2C uses two bidirectional lines: one for data (SDA) and one for clock (SCL). Devices connected on an I2C bus can act as either a master or a slave, allowing for multiple devices to communicate with each other. I2C is popular for its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to connect a variety of devices such as sensors, memory chips, and other peripherals in embedded systems and electronic devices.

#### Connection Overview

The I2C interface is using pin as below, or you can use other I2C interface on J401:

#### Test

Open your terminal(ALT+Ctrl+T) and type the following command:

```
i2cdetect -y -r 7
```

note

Your channel may be different from mine in the commmand: `i2cdetect -y -r x`.

You will see the result as below, before connecting to the I2C, no I2C device was detected on channel 7, but afterwards an I2C device with the address 0x19 was detected.:
