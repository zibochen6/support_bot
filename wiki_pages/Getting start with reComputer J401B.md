The below image is for Orin NX 16GB

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/3.png)

**Step 4.** Remove the jumper wire

### Flash Jetpack OS

note

Before moving onto flashing, it should be noted that Jetson Orin NX module only supports JetPack 5.1 and above, while Jetson Orin Nano module only supports JetPack 5.1.1 and above.

First of all, install the below required dependencies on the Ubuntu Host PC before moving onto flashing JetPack.

```
sudo apt install qemu-user-static sshpass abootimg nfs-kernel-server libxml2-utils binutils -y
```

* JP5.1.1* JP5.1.2* JP5.1.3* JP6.0* JP6.1* JP6.2

Here we will use NVIDIA L4T 35.3.1 to install Jetpack 5.1.1 on the reComputer

**Step 1:** [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-r3531) the NVIDIA drivers on the host PC. The required drivers are shown below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Extract **Jetson\_Linux\_R35.3.1\_aarch64** and **Tegra\_Linux\_Sample-Root-Filesystem\_R35.3.1\_aarch64** by navigating to the folder containing these files, apply the changes and install the necessary prerequisites

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R35.3.1_aarch64  
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R35.3.1_aarch64 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh  
sudo ./tools/l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh
```

**Step 3 (Optional):** Configure your username, password & hostname so that you do not need to enter the Ubuntu installation wizard after the device finishes booting

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u {USERNAME} -p {PASSWORD} -a -n {HOSTNAME} --accept-license
```

For example (username:"nvidia", password:"nvidia", device-name:"nvidia-desktop"):

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u nvidia -p nvidia -a -n nvidia-desktop --accept-license
```

**Step 4:** Flash the system to the NVMe SSD

```
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1 \  
  -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_external.xml -p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" \  
  --showlogs --network usb0 p3509-a02+p3767-0000 internal
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

Now, you can connect the mouse, keyboard, and monitor to the Jetson device. It will be ready to use!

tip

If your Jetson device takes a long time to open the desktop, please reconnect the power supply.

**Step 5 (Optional):** Install Nvidia Jetpack SDK

Please open the terminal on the **Jetson device** and execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```

Here we will use NVIDIA L4T 35.4.1 to install Jetpack 5.1.2 on the reComputer

**Step 1:** [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-r3541) the NVIDIA drivers on the host PC. The required drivers are shown below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Extract **Jetson\_Linux\_R35.4.1\_aarch64** and **Tegra\_Linux\_Sample-Root-Filesystem\_R35.4.1\_aarch64** by navigating to the folder containing these files, apply the changes and install the necessary prerequisites

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R35.4.1_aarch64.tbz2  
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R35.4.1_aarch64.tbz2 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh  
sudo ./tools/l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh
```

Now we need to apply a patch from NVIDIA which is needed for JP5.1.2 and explained [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.4.1/ReleaseNotes/Jetson_Linux_Release_Notes_r35.4.1.pdf) in section 4.2.3 of the official NVIDIA JetPack Release Notes.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the following directory

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra/bootloader/t186ref/BCT
```

**Step 4:** Open the file **"tegra234-mb2-bct-scr-p3767-0000.dts"** and add the following lines under **tfc** section

```
tfc {  
    reg@322 { /* GPIO_M_SCR_00_0 */  
    exclusion-info = <2>;  
    value = <0x38008080>;  
    };
```

**Step 5 (Optional):** Navigate to **"Linux\_for\_Tegra"** directory, and enter the below command to configure your username, password & hostname so that you do not need to enter the Ubuntu installation wizard after the device finishes booting

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra  
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u {USERNAME} -p {PASSWORD} -a -n {HOSTNAME} --accept-license
```

For example (username:"nvidia", password:"nvidia", device-name:"nvidia-desktop"):

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u nvidia -p nvidia -a -n nvidia-desktop --accept-license
```

**Step 6:** Flash the system to the NVMe SSD

```
cp p3509-a02+p3767-0000.conf p3509-a02-p3767-0000.conf  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1   -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_nvme.xml -p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml --no-systemimg"   --showlogs --network usb0 p3509-a02-p3767-0000 external
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

Now, you can connect the mouse, keyboard, and monitor to the Jetson device. It will be ready to use!

tip

If your Jetson device takes a long time to open the desktop, please reconnect the power supply.

**Step 7 (Optional):** Install Nvidia Jetpack SDK

Please open the terminal on the **Jetson device** and execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```

Here we will install Jetpack 5.1.3 on the reComputer.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the unzipped directory and execute the following command to flash jetpack system to the NVMe SSD:

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

**Step 5:** After starting the system, you need to execute the following command to reactivate the wireless network card driver:

```
sudo rm /lib/modules/5.15.136-tegra/build  
sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-5.15.136-tegra-ubuntu22.04_aarch64/3rdparty/canonical/linux-jammy/kernel-source/ /lib/modules/5.15.136-tegra/build  
sudo apt install -y iwlwifi-modules
```

Here we will use NVIDIA L4T 36.4 to install Jetpack 6.1 on the reComputer

**Step 1:** Download the system image to your Ubuntu PC corresponding to the Jetson module you are using:

info

To verify the integrity of the downloaded firmware, you can compare the SHA256 hash value.

On an Ubuntu host machine, open the terminal and run the command `sha256sum <File>` to obtain the SHA256 hash value of the downloaded file. If the resulting hash matches the SHA256 hash provided in the wiki, it confirms that the firmware you downloaded is complete and intact.

**Step 2:** Extract the downloaded image file:

```
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nx-16g-j401-6.1-36.4.0-2024-12-04.tar
```
