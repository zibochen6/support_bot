# Moonfire NVR on reComputer

## Introduction

[Moonfire-NVR](https://github.com/scottlamb/moonfire-nvr) is designed with the goal of providing an easy-to-use NVR system that is lightweight and minimalistic, meaning it doesn’t come with the complexity of other more bloated commercial NVR solutions. It emphasizes functionality and simplicity, enabling users to record from IP cameras directly to a file system or cloud storage.

    command: run  
  
    volumes:  
      # Pass through `/var/lib/moonfire-nvr` from the host.  
      - "/var/lib/moonfire-nvr:/var/lib/moonfire-nvr"  
  
      # Pass through `/etc/moonfire-nvr.toml` from the host.  
      # Be sure to create `/etc/moonfire-nvr.toml` first (see below).  
      # Docker will "helpfully" create a directory by this name otherwise.  
      - "/etc/moonfire-nvr.toml:/etc/moonfire-nvr.toml:ro"  
  
      # Pass through `/var/tmp` from the host.  
      # SQLite expects to be able to create temporary files in this dir, which  
      # is not created in Moonfire's minimal Docker image.  
      # See: <https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html>  
      - "/var/tmp:/var/tmp"  
  
      # Add additional mount lines here for each sample file directory  
      # outside of /var/lib/moonfire-nvr, e.g.:  
      # - "/media/nvr:/media/nvr"  
  
      # The Docker image doesn't include the time zone database; you must mount  
      # it from the host for Moonfire to support local time.  
      - "/usr/share/zoneinfo:/usr/share/zoneinfo:ro"  
  
    # Edit this to match your `moonfire-nvr` user.  
    # Note that Docker will not honor names from the host here, even if  
    # `/etc/passwd` is passed through.  
    # - Be sure to run the `useradd` command below first.  
    # - Then run `echo $(id -u moonfire-nvr):$(id -g moonfire-nvr)` to see  
    #   what should be filled in here.

[[binds]]  
ipv4 = "0.0.0.0:8080"  
allowUnauthenticatedPermissions = { viewVideo = true }
