## 刷写 JetPack

在这里，我们将向您展示如何将 [Jetpack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) 刷写到连接到 reComputer J4012B/ J4011B/ J3010B 和 J3011B 的 NVMe SSD 上。所有这些设备内部都配备了 J401B 载板，刷写过程对所有设备都是相同的。

danger

reComputer J401B 系列在随附的 NVMe SSD 上预装了 JetPack 5.1.3，因此您无需刷写。但是，如果您想再次使用 JetPack 刷写，可以按照本指南操作。

### 支持的模块

* [NVIDIA® Jetson Orin™ Nano 模块 4GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NVIDIA-JETSON-ORIN-NANO-4GB-Module-p-5553.html)
* [NVIDIA® Jetson Orin™ Nano 模块 8GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NVIDIA-JETSON-ORIN-NANO-8GB-Module-p-5551.html?___store=retailer)

* [NVIDIA® Jetson Orin™ NX 模块 16GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NVIDIA-Jetson-Orin-NX-Module-16GB-p-5523.html)

### 前提条件

* Ubuntu 主机电脑
* reComputer J4012B/ J4011B/ J3010B 或 J3011B
* USB Type-C 数据传输线

info

我们建议您使用物理 ubuntu 主机设备而不是虚拟机。
请参考下表准备主机。

note

* 我们不建议使用虚拟机和ARM架构的Ubuntu进行刷写。

### 进入强制恢复模式

在我们进行安装步骤之前，我们需要确保jetson设备处于强制恢复模式。

请参考以下步骤将jetson设备设置为强制恢复模式。

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/J401/j401_set_recovery.gif)

note

动画GIF中的载板是J401，但不用担心——J401和J401B载板进入强制恢复模式的步骤是相同的。

 分步说明 

**步骤 1.** 使用跳线连接 **FC REC** 引脚和 **GND** 引脚。

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**步骤 2.** 通过连接随附的电源适配器线缆为 reComputer 供电，并使用 USB Type-C 数据传输线缆将开发板与 Ubuntu 主机 PC 连接

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/2.png)

**步骤 3.** 在 Linux 主机 PC 上，打开终端窗口并输入命令 `lsusb`。如果返回的内容中包含以下输出之一（根据您使用的 Jetson SoM），则表示开发板处于强制恢复模式。

* 对于 Orin NX 16GB：**0955:7323 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin NX 8GB：**0955:7423 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin Nano 8GB：**0955:7523 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin Nano 4GB：**0955:7623 NVidia Corp**

下图是 Orin NX 16GB 的示例

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/3.png)

**步骤 4.** 移除跳线

### 刷写 Jetpack OS

note

在开始刷写之前，需要注意的是 Jetson Orin NX 模块仅支持 JetPack 5.1 及以上版本，而 Jetson Orin Nano 模块仅支持 JetPack 5.1.1 及以上版本。

首先，在开始刷写 JetPack 之前，请在 Ubuntu 主机 PC 上安装以下必需的依赖项。

```
sudo apt install qemu-user-static sshpass abootimg nfs-kernel-server libxml2-utils binutils -y
```

* JP5.1.1* JP5.1.2* JP5.1.3* JP6.0* JP6.1* JP6.2

这里我们将使用 NVIDIA L4T 35.3.1 在 reComputer 上安装 Jetpack 5.1.1

**步骤 1：** 在主机 PC 上[下载](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-r3531) NVIDIA 驱动程序。所需的驱动程序如下所示：

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/2.jpg)

**步骤 2：** 通过导航到包含这些文件的文件夹来解压 **Jetson\_Linux\_R35.3.1\_aarch64** 和 **Tegra\_Linux\_Sample-Root-Filesystem\_R35.3.1\_aarch64**，应用更改并安装必要的先决条件

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R35.3.1_aarch64  
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R35.3.1_aarch64 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh  
sudo ./tools/l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh
```

**步骤 3（可选）：** 配置您的用户名、密码和主机名，这样您就不需要在设备完成启动后进入 Ubuntu 安装向导

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u {USERNAME} -p {PASSWORD} -a -n {HOSTNAME} --accept-license
```

例如（用户名："nvidia"，密码："nvidia"，设备名称："nvidia-desktop"）：

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u nvidia -p nvidia -a -n nvidia-desktop --accept-license
```

**步骤 4：** 将系统刷写到 NVMe SSD

```
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1 \  
  -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_external.xml -p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" \  
  --showlogs --network usb0 p3509-a02+p3767-0000 internal
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

现在，您可以将鼠标、键盘和显示器连接到 Jetson 设备。它就可以使用了！

tip

如果您的 Jetson 设备打开桌面需要很长时间，请重新连接电源。

**步骤 5（可选）：** 安装 Nvidia Jetpack SDK

请在 **Jetson 设备** 上打开终端并执行以下命令：

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```

这里我们将使用 NVIDIA L4T 35.4.1 在 reComputer 上安装 Jetpack 5.1.2

**步骤 1：** 在主机 PC 上[下载](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-r3541) NVIDIA 驱动程序。所需的驱动程序如下所示：

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/2.jpg)

**步骤 2：** 通过导航到包含这些文件的文件夹来解压 **Jetson\_Linux\_R35.4.1\_aarch64** 和 **Tegra\_Linux\_Sample-Root-Filesystem\_R35.4.1\_aarch64**，应用更改并安装必要的先决条件

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R35.4.1_aarch64.tbz2  
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R35.4.1_aarch64.tbz2 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh  
sudo ./tools/l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh
```

现在我们需要应用来自 NVIDIA 的补丁，这对于 JP5.1.2 是必需的，在官方 NVIDIA JetPack 发布说明的第 4.2.3 节中有[详细说明](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.4.1/ReleaseNotes/Jetson_Linux_Release_Notes_r35.4.1.pdf)。

**步骤 3：** 导航到以下目录

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra/bootloader/t186ref/BCT
```

**步骤 4:** 打开文件 **"tegra234-mb2-bct-scr-p3767-0000.dts"** 并在 **tfc** 部分下添加以下行

```
tfc {  
    reg@322 { /* GPIO_M_SCR_00_0 */  
    exclusion-info = <2>;  
    value = <0x38008080>;  
    };
```

**步骤 5（可选）：** 导航到 **"Linux\_for\_Tegra"** 目录，并输入以下命令来配置您的用户名、密码和主机名，这样设备启动完成后您就无需进入 Ubuntu 安装向导

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra  
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u {USERNAME} -p {PASSWORD} -a -n {HOSTNAME} --accept-license
```

例如（用户名："nvidia"，密码："nvidia"，设备名称："nvidia-desktop"）：

```
sudo tools/l4t_create_default_user.sh -u nvidia -p nvidia -a -n nvidia-desktop --accept-license
```

**步骤 6:** 将系统刷写到 NVMe 固态硬盘

```
cp p3509-a02+p3767-0000.conf p3509-a02-p3767-0000.conf  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1   -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_nvme.xml -p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml --no-systemimg"   --showlogs --network usb0 p3509-a02-p3767-0000 external
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

现在，您可以将鼠标、键盘和显示器连接到 Jetson 设备。它就可以使用了！

tip

如果您的 Jetson 设备打开桌面需要很长时间，请重新连接电源。

**步骤 7（可选）：** 安装 Nvidia Jetpack SDK

请在 **Jetson 设备** 上打开终端并执行以下命令：

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```

在这里我们将在 reComputer 上安装 Jetpack 5.1.3。

**步骤 1：** 根据您使用的 Jetson 模块，将相应的系统镜像下载到您的 Ubuntu PC：

info

为了验证下载固件的完整性，您可以比较 SHA256 哈希值。

在 Ubuntu 主机上，打开终端并运行命令 `sha256sum <文件>` 来获取下载文件的 SHA256 哈希值。如果得到的哈希值与 wiki 中提供的 SHA256 哈希值匹配，则确认您下载的固件是完整无损的。

**步骤 2：** 解压下载的镜像文件：

```
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nano-8g-j401-6.0-36.3.0-2024-06-07.tar.gz
```

**步骤 3：** 导航到解压后的目录并执行以下命令将 jetpack 系统刷写到 NVMe SSD：

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

note

刷写命令可能需要运行 2-10 分钟。

**步骤 4：** 使用板上的 HDMI 连接器将 J401 连接到显示器，并完成初始配置设置。

info

请根据您的需要完成**系统配置**。

这里我们将使用 NVIDIA L4T 36.3 在 reComputer 上安装 Jetpack 6.0

**步骤 1：** 将对应您使用的 Jetson 模块的系统镜像下载到您的 Ubuntu PC：

**步骤 3：** 导航到解压后的目录并执行以下命令将 jetpack 系统刷写到 NVMe SSD：

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

note

刷写命令可能需要运行 2-10 分钟。

**步骤 4：** 使用板上的 HDMI 连接器将 J401 连接到显示器，并完成初始配置设置：

info

请根据您的需要完成**系统配置**。

**步骤 5：** 启动系统后，您需要执行以下命令来重新激活无线网卡驱动程序：

```
sudo rm /lib/modules/5.15.136-tegra/build  
sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-5.15.136-tegra-ubuntu22.04_aarch64/3rdparty/canonical/linux-jammy/kernel-source/ /lib/modules/5.15.136-tegra/build  
sudo apt install -y iwlwifi-modules
```

这里我们将使用 NVIDIA L4T 36.4 在 reComputer 上安装 Jetpack 6.1

**步骤 1：** 将对应您使用的 Jetson 模块的系统镜像下载到您的 Ubuntu PC：

info

为了验证下载固件的完整性，您可以比较 SHA256 哈希值。

在 Ubuntu 主机上，打开终端并运行命令 `sha256sum <文件>` 来获取下载文件的 SHA256 哈希值。如果得到的哈希值与 wiki 中提供的 SHA256 哈希值匹配，则确认您下载的固件是完整无损的。

**步骤 2：** 解压下载的镜像文件：

```
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nx-16g-j401-6.1-36.4.0-2024-12-04.tar
```

**步骤 3：** 导航到解压后的目录并执行以下命令将 jetpack 系统刷写到 NVMe SSD：

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs

note

请注意，由于启用 `super mode` 后功耗和发热量增加，[reComputer J4011B](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4011B-p-6407.html) 和 [reComputer J4012B](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012B-p-6406.html) 无法在最高模式下稳定运行。因此，此次更新不包括这两款产品。
我们目前正在设计新版本的 reComputer。敬请期待！

**步骤 2：** 解压下载的镜像文件：

```
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nano-8g-j401-6.2-36.4.3-2025-02-08.tar.gz
