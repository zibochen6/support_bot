info

我们建议您使用物理 ubuntu 主机设备而不是虚拟机。
请参考下表准备主机。

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 准备 Jetpack 镜像

在这里，我们需要将对应我们使用的 Jetson 模块的系统镜像下载到 Ubuntu PC：

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

danger

Jetpack6 镜像文件大小约为 **14.1GB**，下载时间约为 60 分钟。请耐心等待下载完成。

info

为了验证下载固件的完整性，您可以比较 SHA256 哈希值。

在 Ubuntu 主机上，打开终端并运行命令 `sha256sum <File>` 来获取下载文件的 SHA256 哈希值。如果得到的哈希值与 wiki 中提供的 SHA256 哈希值匹配，则确认您下载的固件是完整无损的。

### 进入强制恢复模式

info

在进行安装步骤之前，我们需要确保开发板处于强制恢复模式。

 分步指南 

**步骤 1.** 将开关切换到 RESET 模式。

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/flash.jpg)

**步骤 2.** 通过连接电源线为 reComputer Super 供电。

**步骤 3.** 使用 USB Type-C 数据传输线将 Super 连接到 Ubuntu 主机 PC。

**步骤 4.** 在 Linux 主机 PC 上，打开终端窗口并输入命令 `lsusb`。如果返回的内容根据您使用的 Jetson SoM 有以下输出之一，则开发板处于强制恢复模式。

* 对于 Orin NX 16GB：**0955:7323 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin NX 8GB：**0955:7423 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin Nano 8GB：**0955:7523 NVidia Corp**
* 对于 Orin Nano 4GB：**0955:7623 NVidia Corp**

下图是 Orin Nano 8GB 的示例

### 刷写到 Jetson

**步骤 1：** 解压下载的镜像文件：

```
cd <path-to-image>  
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-super-orin-nx-16g-j401-6.2-36.4.3-2025-05-22.tar.gz
```

**步骤 2：** 执行以下命令将 jetpack 系统刷写到 NVMe SSD：

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

note

刷写命令可能需要运行 2-10 分钟。

**步骤 3：** 使用 HDMI 线缆连接显示器，并完成 reComputer Super 系统的初始化配置：
