danger

The Jetpack6 image file is approximately **16.7GB** in size and should take around 60 minutes to download. Please kindly wait for the download to complete.

info

To verify the integrity of the downloaded firmware, you can compare the SHA256 hash value.

On an Ubuntu host machine, open the terminal and run the command `sha256sum <File>` to obtain the SHA256 hash value of the downloaded file. If the resulting hash matches the SHA256 hash provided in the wiki, it confirms that the firmware you downloaded is complete and intact.

### Enter Force Recovery Mode

info

Before we can move on to the installation steps, we need to make sure that the board is in force recovery mode.

 Step-by-Step 

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/mini/reComputer_mini_rec.png)

* **Step 1.** Connect a USB Micro-B cable between USB2.0 DEVICE port and the ubuntu host PC.
* **Step 2.** Use a pin and insert into the RECOVERY hole to press recovery button and while holding this.
* **Step 3.** Connect the power supply.
* **Step 4.** Release the recovery button.

On the Linux host PC, open a Terminal window and enter the command `lsusb`. If the returned content has one of the following outputs according to the Jetson SoM you use, then the board is in force recovery mode.

* For Orin NX 16GB: 0955:7323 NVidia Corp
* For Orin NX 8GB: 0955:7423 NVidia Corp
* For Orin Nano 8GB: 0955:7523 NVidia Corp
* For Orin Nano 4GB: 0955:7623 NVidia Corp

The below image is for Orin Nx 16GB:

### Flash to Jetson Step by Step

**Step 1:** Extract the downloaded image file on ubuntu host PC:

```
cd <path-to-image>  
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nano-8g-j401-6.0-36.3.0-2024-06-07.tar.gz
```

**Step 2:** Execute the following command to flash jetpack system to the NVMe SSD:

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

note

The flash command may run for 2-10 minutes.

**Step 3:** Connect the J501 to a display using the HDMI connector on the board and finish the initial configuration setup:

info

Please complete the **System Configuration** according to your needs.

**Step 4 (Optional):** Install Nvidia Jetpack SDK

Please open the terminal on the Jetson device and execute the following commands:

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```
