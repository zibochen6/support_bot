info

Please note, the following updates were made to the product on November 25, 2024:

1. The 5V power supply scheme has been changed (the power IC was replaced from ONNCP3020ADR2G to TI TPS53015DGS, and the peripheral components have been adjusted accordingly), which resolves the issue of device rebooting when using certain USB devices with high dynamic current.
2. The board layout has been optimized to enlarge the slot for the fan cable to accommodate the fan wiring.
3. To stabilize accessory supply, the WiFi module model has been changed from 8265.NGW to BL-M8822CP1, and the software drivers have been updated accordingly.

This wiki will guide you how to install JetPack to Jetson AGX Orin 32GB H01 Kit.

## Prerequisites

* [Ubuntu Host PC](https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager) (native or VM using VMware Workstation Player).
* Jetson AGX Orin H01 Kit.
* USB Type-C data transmission cable

## Enter Force Recovery Mode

* **Step 1:** There is a recovery button on the board, which is in the middle of the three buttons as shown in the below picture. Hold the recovery button and then connect the board to the power supply to enter force recovery mode.

## Flash to Jetson

danger

NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Orin 32GB H01 Kit comes pre-installed with the `JetPack 5.1.4` operating system. The default username and password are user: nvidia / password: nvidia. Upon receiving the device, you can directly log into the system and start using it without the need to reflash the system.

If your system becomes corrupted, you can refer to the steps below to reflash the system.

* JP5.0.2/JP5.1.1* JP5.1.4* JP6.0* JP6.1* JP6.2

Here we will use: **NVIDIA L4T 35.1** to install **Jetpack 5.0.2** or **NVIDIA L4T 35.3.1** to install **Jetpack 5.1.1** on the Jetson AGX Orin 32GB H01 Kit.

* **Step 1:** Download appropriate NVIDIA drivers on the host PC. The required drivers are shown below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/2.jpg)

* **Step 2:** Move the downloaded peripheral drivers from before into the same folder with NVIDIA drivers. Now you will see three compressed files in the same folder.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/7.png)

* **Step 3:** Extract **Jetson\_Linux\_R35.1.0\_aarch64.tbz2** and **Tegra\_Linux\_Sample-Root-Filesystem\_R35.1.0\_aarch64.tbz2** by navigating to the folder containing these files and apply the changes

```
cd <directory_where_the_files_are_located>  
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R35.1.0_aarch64.tbz2  
cd Linux_for_tegra/rootfs  
sudo tar xfp ../../Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R35.1.0_aarch64.tbz2  
cd ..  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh
```

* **Step 4:** Extract **AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-JP5.0.2.zip**. Here we additionally install the **unzip** package which is needed to decompress the .zip file

```
cd ..  
sudo apt install unzip   
unzip AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-JP5.0.2.zip
```

Here it will ask whether to replace the files. Type **A** and press **ENTER** to replace the necessary files

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Jetson-AGX-Orin-32GB-H01-Kit/3.jpg)

* **Step 5:** Flash the system to the eMMC

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra  
sudo ./flash.sh jetson‐agx‐orin‐devkit mmcblk0p1
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

### Encountered Errors

* **ERROR: failed to read rcm\_state** on **AGX Orin** and **NX Orin** for *Jetpack 5.1.1*
  + There is PCN changes on Jetson AGX Orin made by NVidia, but it's not Seeed's PCN changes.
  + Beside materials mentioned in Wiki, please download [Overlay\_PCN210361\_PCN210100\_r35.3.1.tbz2](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v3.1/overlay_pcn210361_pcn210100_r35.3.1.tbz2) at bottom of the page Jetson Linux 35.3.1.
  + After extracting *Jetson\_Linux* and before applying binaries, please extract *Overlay\_PCN210361\_PCN210100\_r35.3.1.tbz2*. Then copy all files, folders to *Linux\_For\_Tegra* (merge, not skip).
  + Then continue remaining steps in guidances.

Here we will use: **NVIDIA L4T 35.6.0** to install **Jetpack 5.1.4** on the Jetson AGX Orin 32GB H01 Kit.

Enter the following command in the terminal window of the Ubuntu host machine:

```
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v6.0/release/jetson_linux_r35.6.0_aarch64.tbz2  
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v6.0/release/tegra_linux_sample-root-filesystem_r35.6.0_aarch64.tbz2  
  
tar xf jetson_linux_r35.6.0_aarch64.tbz2  
sudo tar xpf tegra_linux_sample-root-filesystem_r35.6.0_aarch64.tbz2 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./tools/l4t_flash_prerequisites.sh  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh  
sudo tar xf 605_jp514.tbz2  # Please copy 605_jp514.tbz2 to the Linux_for_Tegra/ directory before execution.
```

Choose one of the following commands to perform the flashing operation:

(1). Flash the system to eMMC:

```
sudo ./flash.sh jetson-agx-orin-devkit internal
```

(2). Flash the system to the SSD:

```
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --external-device nvme0n1p1 \  
  -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme.xml \  
  --showlogs --network usb0 jetson-agx-orin-devkit external
```
