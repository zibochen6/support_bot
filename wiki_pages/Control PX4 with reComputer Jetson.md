* **(SBUS Signal):** Connect SBUS or DSM/Spektrum receiver's signal wire here.
* **(RSSI Signal):** Sends the RC signal strength info to autopilot.

CRITICAL: Set Serial Port Permissions

To avoid using `sudo` for every serial command, you must add your user to the `dialout` group. This is a crucial one-time setup.

```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

**You must reboot the Jetson for this change to take effect!**

## Choosing Your Method: A Comparison

Before diving in, understand the trade-offs. The right choice depends entirely on your project's goals.

## Method 1: uXRCE-DDS (Native ROS 2 Integration)")

This is PX4's official solution for ROS 2, bridging its internal `uORB` messaging system directly into the ROS 2 network for zero-overhead communication.

### Step 1: Compile the Micro XRCE-DDS Agent

The Agent is a small program on the Jetson that acts as a broker between the flight controller's serial connection and the ROS 2 network.

Terminal on Jetson

```
# 1. Clone the specific version of the Agent repository  
cd ~  
git clone -b v2.4.2 https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git  
cd Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent  
  
# 2. IMPORTANT: Patch the Fast-DDS dependency version  
# The v2.12.x tag for fastdds was removed by the vendor; we update it to a working one.  
sed -i 's/v2.12.x/v2.13.x/g' SuperBuild.cmake  
  
# 3. Build and install the Agent  
mkdir build && cd build  
cmake ..  
make  
sudo make install # Installs MicroXRCEAgent globally
```

![PX4_dev_01](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/01.png)![PX4_dev_02](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/02.png)![PX4_dev_03](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/03.png)![PX4_dev_04](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/04.png)

### Step 2: Build the `px4_msgs` ROS 2 Package

To allow ROS 2 to understand PX4's topics, you must build its message definitions.

Terminal on Jetson

```
# 1. Create a ROS 2 workspace  
mkdir -p ~/px4_ros_ws/src  
cd ~/px4_ros_ws/src  
  
# 2. Clone the required repositories  
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs.git  
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com.git # Contains examples  
  
# 3. Checkout the branch matching your firmware version  
cd px4_msgs  
git checkout release/1.15  
  
# 4. Build the workspace  
cd ~/px4_ros_ws  
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  
colcon build
```

Hardware Compatibility for uXRCE-DDS

The `px4_msgs` version **must** align with your PX4 firmware version. This is critical for compatibility.

Furthermore, full native ROS 2 support via uXRCE-DDS, which became standard in PX4 firmware v1.14 and later, requires flight controllers with **2MB of flash memory** (like the Pixhawk 4 Mini used in this guide).

Older, classic hardware like the popular **Pixhawk 2.4.8** (and other FMUv2-based boards) only have 1MB of flash. They cannot run the standard pre-built firmware required for this uXRCE-DDS method. While creating a custom, stripped-down firmware is theoretically possible, it is a complex process.

**If you are using a Pixhawk 2.4.8 or another 1MB flash board, we strongly recommend you skip this method and proceed directly to [Method 2 (MAVSDK)](#4-method-2-mavsdk-high-level-api) or [Method 3 (MAVROS)](#5-method-3-mavros-the-powerful-ros-bridge), as both use the MAVLink protocol which is fully supported on your hardware.**

info

The `px4_msgs` branch **must** match your PX4 firmware version to ensure the message definitions are compatible.

![PX4_dev_01](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/05.png)![PX4_dev_02](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/06.png)

### Step 3: Configure PX4 Firmware

Connect to QGroundControl and set the following parameters:

1. **`UXRCE_DDS_CFG`**: Set to `TELEM1`. This activates the XRCE-DDS client on that port.
2. **`SER_TEL1_BAUD`**: Set to `921600 8N1`.
3. **`MAV_1_CONFIG`**: Set to `Disabled`. This is crucial to prevent MAVLink from conflicting on the same port.
4. Save parameters and reboot the flight controller.

### Step 4: Launch and Verify

1. **Start the Agent on the Jetson** (in one terminal):

   Terminal 1: Run Agent

   ```
   MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/ttyTHS1 -b 921600
   ```
2. **Verify ROS 2 Topics** (in a new terminal):

   Terminal 2: Verify Topics

   ```
   # Source your workspace in every new terminal  
   source ~/px4_ros_ws/install/setup.bash  
     
   # You should see a list of topics starting with /fmu/  
   ros2 topic list | grep /fmu/  
     
   # Echo a topic to see live data streaming from the FCU  
   ros2 topic echo /fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
   ```

![PX4_dev_01](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/11.png)![PX4_dev_02](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/PX4_dev/12.png)

## Method 2: MAVSDK (High-Level API)")

MAVSDK provides a simple, modern API to control drones programmatically, abstracting away the complexities of the MAVLink protocol. It's perfect for writing high-level mission scripts.

### Step 1: Configure PX4 Firmware

In QGroundControl, switch the port configuration from DDS back to MAVLink mode.

1. **`UXRCE_DDS_CFG`**: Set back to `Disabled`.
2. **`MAV_1_CONFIG`**: Set to `TELEM 1` to assign the port to MAVLink.
3. **`MAV_1_MODE`**: Set to `Onboard` to specify the link is for a companion computer.
4. **`SER_TEL1_BAUD`**: Ensure this is still `921600 8N1`.
5. Save parameters and reboot the flight controller.

### Step 2: Install MAVSDK-Python

Terminal on Jetson

```
pip3 install mavsdk
```

### Step 3: Write and Run a Control Script

This Python script connects, takes off to 10 meters, waits, and then lands.

takeoff\_and\_land.py

```
import asyncio  
from mavsdk import System  
  
async def run():  
    # Create a drone object and connect to the flight controller  
    drone = System()  
    await drone.connect(system_address="serial:///dev/ttyTHS1:921600")  
  
    print("Waiting for drone to connect...")  
    # This is an asynchronous generator that yields connection state updates  
    async for state in drone.core.connection_state():  
        if state.is_connected:  
            print("--> Drone discovered!")  
            break  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    # Run the asyncio event loop  
    asyncio.run(run())
```

Execute the script from your terminal: `python3 takeoff_and_land.py`.

---

## Method 3: MAVROS (The Powerful ROS Bridge)")

MAVROS is the battle-tested MAVLink-to-ROS gateway, offering comprehensive functionality and unparalleled stability for complex ROS-based systems.

### Step 1: Configure PX4 Firmware

The PX4 configuration for MAVROS is **identical to the MAVSDK setup**. Ensure `TELEM1` is configured for MAVLink in `Onboard` mode.

### Step 2: Install MAVROS and Dependencies

Terminal on Jetson

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install ros-humble-mavros ros-humble-mavros-msgs
```

Prevent a Common Crash!

MAVROS requires a geographic dataset for coordinate transformations. A missing dataset is a common cause of crashes on startup. This script downloads and installs it.

Terminal on Jetson

```
sudo bash /opt/ros/humble/lib/mavros/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```

### Step 3: Launch and Verify

1. **Launch the MAVROS node**:

   Terminal 1: Launch MAVROS

   ```
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  
     
   # Launch mavros, specifying the FCU connection URL via a parameter  
   ros2 launch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="serial:///dev/ttyTHS1:921600"
   ```
2. **Verify the Connection**:

   In a new terminal, echo the MAVROS state topic.

   Terminal 2: Verify Connection

   ```
   ros2 topic echo /mavros/state
   ```

   Watch the output. Once the `connected` field changes to `true`, MAVROS is communicating successfully with your PX4.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you run into trouble, check these common issues first.

* **"Permission Denied" on Serial Port:** You forgot to add your user to the `dialout` group and reboot. See the "Hardware Connection" section.
* **"No such file or directory" for `/dev/ttyTHS1`:** Double-check your physical wiring. Is the flight controller powered on? Run `ls /dev/ttyTHS*` to confirm the device name.
* **MAVROS Crashes on Startup:** You likely missed the `install_geographiclib_dataset.sh` step. Run the command from Method 3.
* **`colcon build` Fails:** Make sure you have sourced the ROS 2 environment first (`source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`). For more complex dependency issues, you might need to run `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`.

## Final Words

You now have three powerful methods for enabling communication between a Jetson Orin and a PX4 flight controller. The best tool depends on your project's architecture, performance needs, and development speed. By understanding the trade-offs, you can build a robust foundation for any autonomous drone application.
