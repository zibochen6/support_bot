# Getting Started with Scailable on NVIDIA® Jetson Devices

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Scailable/wiki-thumb-4.gif)

## What is Scailable?

[Scailable](https://scailable.net) provides a platform for creating and managing Edge AI solutions at scale. With Scailable, you can simply configure any supported edge device (such as a router, gateway, or IPC) to turn it into a "smart" device. Smart devices can run advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models on input data, such as a video stream, to turn the input into something meaningful, such as a count of the number of cars in the video.

## Why Scailable on NVIDIA Jetson?

NVIDIA Jetson platform is a great candidate to run Scailable because, as an Edge AI device including NVIDIA SoMs, it is able to give a better inference performance after deploying various AI pipelines over-the-air at scale to these devices.

This wiki will walkthrough how you can easily install Scailable AI Manager on the NVIDIA Jetson platform and use Scailable Platform to remotely configure and manage your AI solution at scale.

## Prerequisites

* NVIDIA Jetson device running NVIDIA JetPack 5.0+ and connected to the internet

  + We have tested this wiki with [reComputer J4012](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html) running [JetPack 5.1.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-511). If you want to explore more NVIDIA Jetson devices offered by Seeed, please visit [this page](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/NVIDIA/NVIDIA-Jetson-Devices-and-carrier-boards-comparision.pdf).
* Host PC with Windows, Linux or Mac and connected to the internet

## Install Scailable AI Manager

**Step 1:** Execute the below command to install Scailable AI Manager on the Jetson Orin device

```
sudo bash -ic "$(wget -q -O - https://get.sclbl.net)"
```

note

During the installation, you need to enter "y" to the prompt which asks you to enable JetPack 5 support.
