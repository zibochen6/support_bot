# Getting Started with reComputer Super

The reComputer Super Series supercharges the reComputer Classic, delivering up to a 1.7x boost of 157 TOPS in AI performance. It features models with Jetson Orin Nano (11410311, 11410312) and Jetson Orin NX (11410313, 11410314).
Designed for both development and production, it comes with a rich array of interfaces, including M.2 Key E/M, dual RJ45 Ethernet, Mini-PCIe, 4xUSB 3.2, HDMI 2.1, 4xCSI, and CAN. With pre-installed Jetpack 6.2 and Linux OS BSP, it enables immediate market entry.
It also supports a wide range of LLM & Physical AI frameworks, such as NVIDIA, Hugging Face, ONNX, PyTorch, and ROS2/1 at the edge seamlessly, even merging these multimodal capacity with robotics application to enrich Physical AI development.

danger

The Jetpack6 image file is approximately **14.1GB** in size and should take around 60 minutes to download. Please kindly wait for the download to complete.

info

To verify the integrity of the downloaded firmware, you can compare the SHA256 hash value.

On an Ubuntu host machine, open the terminal and run the command `sha256sum <File>` to obtain the SHA256 hash value of the downloaded file. If the resulting hash matches the SHA256 hash provided in the wiki, it confirms that the firmware you downloaded is complete and intact.

### Enter Force Recovery Mode

info

Before we can move on to the installation steps, we need to make sure that the board is in force recovery mode.

 Step-by-Step 

**Step 1.** Switch the switch to the RESET mode.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/flash.jpg)

**Step 2.** Power up the reComputer Super by connecting the power cable.

**Step 3.** Connect the Super to the Ubuntu host PC with a USB Type-C data transmission cable.

**Step 4.** On the Linux host PC, open a Terminal window and enter the command `lsusb`. If the returned content has one of the following outputs according to the Jetson SoM you use, then the board is in force recovery mode.

* For Orin NX 16GB: **0955:7323 NVidia Corp**
* For Orin NX 8GB: **0955:7423 NVidia Corp**
* For Orin Nano 8GB: **0955:7523 NVidia Corp**
* For Orin Nano 4GB: **0955:7623 NVidia Corp**

The below image is for Orin Nano 8GB

### Flash to Jetson

**Step 1:** Extract the downloaded image file:

```
cd <path-to-image>  
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-super-orin-nx-16g-j401-6.2-36.4.3-2025-05-22.tar.gz
```

**Step 2:** Execute the following command to flash jetpack system to the NVMe SSD:

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

You will see the following output if the flashing process is successful

note

The flash command may run for 2-10 minutes.

**Step 3:** Connect the monitor using an HDMI cable and complete the initialization configuration of the reComputer Super system:
