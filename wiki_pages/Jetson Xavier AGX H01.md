#### Getting Started

The example here is using **NVIDIA L4T 32.7.1** to install **Jetpack 4.6.1** on the Jetson AGX H01.

* **Step 1**. [Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra-r3271) the drivers on the host PC form NVIDIA. The required 32.7.1 drivers are shown below:

* **Step 2**. [Download](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/H01Driver/H01_Driver.zip) additional required installation files **H01\_Drivers** on the host PC.

Move downloaded files at **Step 1** into the same folder with **H01\_Drivers**. Now you will see three unzipped files in the same folder.

* **Step 3**. Unzip the file of **AGX\_H01\_Drivers.zip**.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/H01Driver/h01driver1b.png)

* **Step 4**. Open terminal in the folder and unzip the rest files. Execute the command below:

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_R32.7.1_aarch64.tbz2  
cd Linux_for_tegra/rootfs  
sudo tar xfp ../../Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R32.7.1_aarch64.tbz2  
cd ..  
sudo  ./apply_binaries.sh
```

!!!Note
If you donwnload files in somewhere else, make sure you add the path to the files. Like example here is "/Desktop/AGX/". If you directly open the terminal in the file, the path will be automatically added.

The command lines should be like:

* **Step 5**. Move back and copy & paste the file from downloaded **H01\_Driver** file to the unzipped file **Jetson\_Linux\_R32.6.1\_aarch64.tbz2**.

Here are the commands below:

```
cd ..  
cp -a -f H01_Driver/Linux_for_Tegra/kernel Linux_for_Tegra/  
cd Linux_for_Tegra/  
sudo ./flash.sh jetson-xavier mmcblk0p1
```

The flash will be running and the progress is like:
