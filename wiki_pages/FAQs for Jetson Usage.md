#### Q6: Timeout issue during flash Jetpack.

For details, please click [here](/usb_timeout_during_flash/)

#### Q7: I cannot use USB-A port, Ethernet port or no HDMI dispaly after flashing the device.

**A:** Please check file integrity (for instance, we provided the SHA256 cheksums), for some carrier boards (especially A60X series), make sure that the driver patch was successfully copied/applied to **Linux\_for\_tegra** directory. There are files that require **sudo** permission, and when you copy directories, make sure **-r** parameter is included in your command.

#### Q8: My system crashed/unable to boot/black screen/lost peripheral drivers after I execute "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" commands.

**A:** These issues can be concluded as **"Why can't I upgrade the system with apt upgrade on custom carrier boards?"** The short answer is: **Do not** run the apt upgrade command on **custom/third-party** carrier boards. Additionally, avoid running any scripts that include apt upgrade commands or using GUI updater tools in Ubuntu. Debian packages from the server do not account for the specific design of our custom boards, and forcing the upgrade can cause incompatibilities that may brick your device. This process is only compatible with the official devkit. To solve these issues, please follow our guide to reflash the JetPack.

#### Q9: How can I upgrade software packages if you told me that I cannot execute apt upgrade? Will there be security risks if I don't upgrade the software?

#### Q14: How to Build the Source Code Project for Seeed's Jetson BSP?

For details, please click [here](/how_to_build_the_source_code_project_for_seeed_jetson_bsp/)

#### Q15: Why can’t the `apt upgrade` command be executed on reComputer/reServer?

The kernels and drivers of **reComputer/reServer** are customized. If the `apt upgrade` command is executed, some kernel and driver related packages may be replaced with NVIDIA’s official resources, which could cause software compatibility issues. Therefore, please do not run `apt upgrade` on any third-party Jetson platforms.

You can refer to the following instructions to lock the relevant APT sources. This way, if apt upgrade is accidentally executed, the impact will be minimized:

```
sudo apt-mark hold <package-name>  
  
### For example:   
sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-l4t-core
```

#### Q16: If the reComputer/reServer does not have the required `.ko` driver module, how can I compile a usable driver?

For details, please click [here](/how_to_build_the_ko_module_for_seeed_jetson/)

#### Q17：How can I mount an external hard drive formatted with exFAT on Jetson (JetPack 6)??")

First, install the dependencies:

```
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config  
sudo apt install git libfuse-dev
```

Then clone and build the exFAT driver from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/relan/exfat  
cd exfat  
autoreconf --install  
./configure  
make  
sudo make install
```

Next, manually mount the disk to a local directory:

```
lsblk   # Check the device name of your external hard drive  
  
sudo mkdir /media/seeed/tmp-exfat   # Create a mount point  
sudo mount.exfat /dev/sda3 /media/seeed/tmp-exfat/
```

This mounts the exFAT-formatted external drive to `/media/seeed/tmp-exfat/` so that it can be accessed normally on the Jetson.
