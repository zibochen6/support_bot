reComputer industrial series offers full systems including NVIDIA Jetson™ Xavier NX/ Orin Nano/Orin NX/ modules, ranging from 20 TOPS to 100 TOPS AI performance. Preinstalled with Jetpack 5.1.1, reComputer industrial simplifies development, ideal for bulding applications of video analytics, object detection, natural language processing, medical imaging, and robots, which brings digital transformantion across industries of smart cities, security, industrial automation, smart factories.

reComputer industrial comes with a passive heatsink and a fanless design, making it ideal for use in demanding environments. The passive heatsink allows for efficient cooling without the need for a fan, reducing the risk of component failure due to dust or other contaminants. The fanless design also reduces noise levels and power consumption, making it suitable for use in noise-sensitive environments and minimizing energy costs.

reComputer industrial has 2 RJ45 GbE ports, one of which is a PoE PSE port for providing power over Ethernet to devices like IP cameras. This eliminates the need for a separate power source and makes it easier to deploy network devices in areas without readily available power outlets. The other GbE port is used to connect to a network switch or router, enabling communication with other devices on the network and access to the Internet.

info

To verify the integrity of the downloaded firmware, you can compare the SHA256 hash value.

On an Ubuntu host machine, open the terminal and run the command `sha256sum <File>` to obtain the SHA256 hash value of the downloaded file. If the resulting hash matches the SHA256 hash provided in the wiki, it confirms that the firmware you downloaded is complete and intact.

info

The source code for the above images can be found [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Linux_for_Tegra).

* **Step 2:** Extract the generated file

```
sudo tar -xvf <file_name>.tar.gz
```

* **Step 3:** Navigate to the extracted file from before and execute the flash command as follows

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0 --showlogs
```

Now it will start to flash the system image to the board. If the flashing is successful, you will see the below output

Please complete the **System Configuration** according to your needs.

danger

If you are using an **Orin NX 16GB/8GB** module, **do not enable MAXN SUPER mode**.
The cooling capacity of the reComputer industrial J4011/J4012 is insufficient to support it, and forcing this mode may result in permanent damage to the module.

* **Step 1:** Download the system image to your Ubuntu PC corresponding to the board you are using

note

Please note that due to the increased power consumption and heat generation after enabling `super mode`, the [reComputer Industrial J4011](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-Industrial-J4011-p-5681.html) and [reComputer Industrial J4012](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-Industrial-J4012-p-5684.html) cannot operate stably in the highest mode. Therefore, this update does not include these two products.
We are currently designing a new version of reComputer. Stay tuned!
