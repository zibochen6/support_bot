# Control Motor by Voice LLM on Jetson

## Introduction

This wiki builds an end-to-end voice-controlled motor system based on the Jetson platform (reComputer Robotics J4012), integrating speech recognition, edge large language model (LLM) intent understanding, and hardware control to enable natural human-machine interaction—users can control MyActuator X Series Motors with simple voice commands (e.g., "Rotate 90 degrees clockwise").

## Prerequisites

* reComputer Robotics J4012
* reSpeaker XVF3800
* MyActuator X Series Motors

## Hardware Connection

## Getting Started

The workflow of the entire system involves three steps:

1. ASR: The microphone captures audio commands from the user and converts them into text using Whisper.
2. Function Calling: The large language model generates motor control parameters that meet the requirements based on the user's input instructions.
3. Motor Control: The appropriate control program is called to drive the motor to rotate to the specified position.

Next, we will explain the implementation of each step in detail.

### Install Whisper Server

First, we need to install the Whisper service to enable ASR functionality. Please open a terminal window on the Jetson device and run the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/jjjadand/whisper-stable4curl  
cd whisper-stable4curl  
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}  
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}  
cmake --build build -j --config Release
```

If everything goes well, you will see the following logs in the terminal window.

Then we launch the Whisper inference service:

```
./build/bin/whisper-stream -m ./models/ggml-base.en-q5_1.bin -t 8 --step 0 --length 7000 -vth 0.7 --keep 1200
```

### Install Ollama

Ollama is an extremely user-friendly edge computing LLM inference framework that can be deployed on Jetson with just a single command. Open a new terminal window on your Jetson device and execute:

```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  
ollama pull qwen2.5
```

info

Here, we use the Qwen 2.5 large language model to understand the user's intent.

### Install Motor Control Script

Execute the following command to start the motor control script:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuyoujiang/voice_control.git  
cd voice_control  
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000  
sudo ip link set can0 up  
python app.py
```
