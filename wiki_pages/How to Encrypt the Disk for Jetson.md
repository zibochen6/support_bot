# How to Encrypt the Disk for Jetson

**This wiki takes L4T 36.4.3 and reComputer J401 as examples, providing reference steps for Jetson disk encryption.
The disk encryption process must be performed during flashing. If your disk needs to be encrypted, you will have to reconfigure and re-flash the system.**

**Before flashing, ensure that you have a properly built image source, as detailed in the following steps.**

## 1. Prepare workspace

This section takes **L4T 36.4.3** as an example to demonstrate how to build the source code project and compile it. The same process applies to other versions—simply **replace the version number in the subsequent example commands with your desired build version**.

Before getting start, you need to prepare an **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 PC host**.

If you're unsure about the relationship between L4T versions and JetPack versions, you can refer to this link:
<https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-archive>.

Search for the specific **L4T (Linux for Tegra)** release you want to compile, e.g.:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/google_L4T.jpg)

Extract the official BSP from NVIDIA, and you will get a directory named `Linux_for_Tegra`. Then, extract the root file system archive into the official `Linux_for_Tegra` directory:

```
tar xf Jetson_Linux_r36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2  
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_r36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/
```

Sync the source code for compiling. Replace the argument after `-t` with **the L4T version you want**:

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra/source/  
./source_sync.sh -t jetson_36.4.3
```

Exit to the root directory of your workspace. Git clone the source code of your desired branch to your local machine using the following command
(replace `-b <branch name>` with the target branch):

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install git-lfs  
cd ../..  
mkdir -p github/Linux_for_Tegra  
git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Linux_for_Tegra.git -b r36.4.3 --depth=1 github/Linux_for_Tegra
```

The BSP source code for Seeed's Jetson is available in **this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Linux_for_Tegra/tree/main).**
You can check the different branches to find your desired L4T version, as each branch corresponds to a different L4T release.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/github_L4T.jpg)

Then overwrite the original source code:

```
cp -r github/Linux_for_Tegra/* Linux_for_Tegra/
```

Apply necessary changes to rootfs:

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra  
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh
```

Install dependencies on your PC:

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev  
sudo apt-get install sshpass  
sudo apt-get install abootimg  
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server  
sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils  
sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
```

prepare work for kernel build:

```
mkdir -p l4t-gcc  
tar xf aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1.tar.bz2 -C ./l4t-gcc  
export ARCH=arm64  
export CROSS_COMPILE=/your_path/l4t-gcc/aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1/bin/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu-
```

Compile and build kernel:

```
cd source  
./nvbuild.sh
```

Install new kernel dtbs and drivers:

```
./do_copy.sh  
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/your_path/Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/  
./nvbuild.sh -i
```

## 2. Encrypted File Generation and Flashing Guide

Enter the previously prepared and compiled source directory:

```
cd Linux_for_Tegra
```

Install dependencies：

```
sudo apt-get install python3-cryptography python3-cffi-backend libxml2-utils   
sudo apt-get install python3-pycryptodome python3-crypto  
sudo apt-get install cryptsetup  
  
  
pip install cryptography  
pip install pycrypto  
pip install --user --upgrade pycryptodome
```

Generate encrypted files based on `OPTEE`. Execute the following commands to generate the encrypted files `eks_t234.img` and `sym2_t234.key`:

```
cd source/tegra/optee-src/nv-optee/optee/samples/hwkey-agent/host/tool/gen_ekb  
  
openssl rand -hex 32 > sym_t234.key  
openssl rand -hex 16 > sym2_t234.key  
openssl rand -hex 16 > auth_t234.key  
openssl rand -hex 32 > oem_k1.key  
  
./example.sh
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/optee-output.png
)

Copy the `eks_t234.img` and `sym2_t234.key` to the specified directories in your source folder:

```
cp eks_t234.img /your_path/cd Linux_for_Tegra/bootloader/  
sudo cp sym2_t234.key /your_path/Linux_for_Tegra
```

The following example demonstrates how to generate the image using the `reComputer J401` as an example:

```
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh \  
  --network usb0 \  
  --no-flash \  
  --showlogs \  
  -p "-c bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" \  
  recomputer-orin-j401 \  
  internal
```

Replace `recomputer-orin-j401` with the name of the device you are using. You need to provide a valid `device name` as a parameter, which you can find by checking the .conf filenames in the root directory of `Linux_for_Tegra`. The prefix of these filenames corresponds to the valid `device name` parameters.

)

tip

For JetPack 5, since the file paths are different, you need to modify the `-p` parameter to:
`-p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml"`

Therefore, the available device name parameters for **L4T 36.4.3** are as follows. The **j40** and **j30** series use the same configuration file:

* recomputer-industrial-orin-j201 (recomputer-industrial-orin-j40/j30 also uses this `device name` as the parameter.)
* recomputer-orin-j401
* reserver-agx-orin-j501x
* reserver-agx-orin-j501x-gmsl
* reserver-industrial-orin-j401
* recomputer-orin-j40mini
* recomputer-orin-robotics-j401
* recomputer-orin-super-j401

Copy `eks_t234_sigheader.img.encrypt` to the target directory:

```
sudo cp bootloader/eks_t234_sigheader.img.encrypt ./tools/kernel_flash/images/internal/
```

In the Linux\_for\_Tegra directory, run the following command to flash the encrypted root filesystem.
Again, replace `recomputer-orin-j401` with the corresponding device name for your board.

```
sudo ROOTFS_ENC=1 \  
./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh \  
  --external-device nvme0n1p1 \                    
  -i ./sym2_t234.key \                              
  -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme_rootfs_enc.xml \    
  -S 80GiB \                                        
  -p "-c bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" \    
  --showlogs \                                      
  --network usb0 \                                  
  recomputer-orin-j401 internal
```

During this flashing process, the storage on your Jetson device will be encrypted.

warning

Please make sure to keep the encryption files generated by `OPTEE` securely, as they will be required later for decryption.

## 3. Retrieve the Decryption Password

In the previously built source directory `Linux_for_Tegra`, copy the `sym2_t234.key` file to the following location:

```
cp source/tegra/optee-src/nv-optee/optee/samples/hwkey-agent/host/tool/gen_ekb/sym2_t234.key source/tegra/optee-src/nv-optee/optee/samples/luks-srv/host/tool/gen_luks_passphrase
```

Then, generate the decryption password based on the `UUID` and `BR_CID` obtained during the flashing process:

```
cd source/tegra/optee-src/nv-optee/optee/samples/luks-srv/host/tool/gen_luks_passphrase  
  
  
python3 gen_luks_passphrase.py -k sym2_t234.key -c "UUID of the disk" -u -e "BR_CID"  
# For example  
python gen_luks_passphrase.py -k sym2_t234.key -c "551df6eb-fa80-431c-bb54-121481e53bae" -u -e '0x80012344705E01D15C00000015020180'
```

The values of `UUID` and `BR_CID` can be found in the log files under Linux\_for\_Tegra/initrdlog.
Locate the corresponding log file based on the timestamp of your flashing operation to retrieve these values.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BR CID UUID|  |  | | --- | --- | | | | | |

`gen_luks_passphrase.py`will briefly display the decryption password in the terminal — please make sure to record it immediately before it disappears.
