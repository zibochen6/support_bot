This wiki provides a step-by-step guide to deploying [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) models on reComputer Jetson devices for efficient AI inference on the edge.

## Prerequisites

* Jetson device with more than 8GB of memory.
* The jetson device needs to be pre-flashed with the jetpack [5.1.1](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_Intro/) operating system or later.

note

In this wiki, we will accomplish the following tasks using the [reComputer J4012 - Edge AI Computer with NVIDIA® Jetson™ Orin™ NX 16GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html?qid=eyJjX3NlYXJjaF9xdWVyeSI6InJlQ29tcHV0ZXIgSjQwMTIiLCJjX3NlYXJjaF9yZXN1bHRfcG9zIjo0LCJjX3RvdGFsX3Jlc3VsdHMiOjUyLCJjX3NlYXJjaF9yZXN1bHRfdHlwZSI6IlByb2R1Y3QiLCJjX3NlYXJjaF9maWx0ZXJzIjoic3RvcmVDb2RlOltyZXRhaWxlcl0gJiYgcXVhbnRpdHlfYW5kX3N0b2NrX3N0YXR1czpbMV0ifQ%3D%3D), but you can also try using other Jetson devices.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Connection

* Connect the Jetson device to the network, mouse, keyboard, and monitor.

note

Of course, you can also remotely access the Jetson device via SSH over the local network.

### Install Ollama Inference Engine

Ollama is a lightweight and efficient inference engine designed for running large language models (LLMs) locally with minimal setup. It simplifies the deployment of AI models by providing an easy-to-use interface and optimized runtime for various hardware configurations, including Jetson devices.

To install Ollama, open the terminal window on the Jetson device and run the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

This script will automatically download and set up Ollama on your system, enabling seamless local inference for AI applications.

### Load and Run DeepSeek

Ollama now supports various versions of the DeepSeek models, allowing us to deploy different model sizes based on our needs. For demonstration purposes, we will use the default DeepSeek-R1 7B model.

```
ollama run deepseek-r1
```

This command downloads and prepares the DeepSeek model for local inference using Ollama.
Once the model has finished loading, you can enter your query in the terminal window.
