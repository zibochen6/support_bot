# Use SQLite on reComputer

## Introduction

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/00_AI_Sensing/Application/sqlite/sqlite.jpg)

This wiki explains how to use the [SQlite](https://sqlite.org/) on reComputer box. SQLite is a lightweight, embedded relational database management system widely used in mobile devices, desktop applications, and embedded systems. It does not require a separate server process; the database is stored directly in a single ordinary disk file. SQLite is simple to use and offers excellent performance. It supports standard SQL syntax and is suitable for small to medium-sized data storage needs. Due to its zero-configuration and easy deployment features, SQLite has become the preferred database engine for many projects.

## Prepare software

### update the system

```
sudo date -s "$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"  
sudo apt update  
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

### Install SQlite

```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
```

### Creat database

```
sqlite3 sensordata.db
```

With the `.help` command you can be quickly reminded of all the supported commands and their respective usage.

```
sqlite> .help
```

Then use `.quit` to quit SQlite shell.

```
sqlite> .quit
```

## Using SQL

### SQL creat table

```
sqlite3 sensordata.db
```

Then use command like below to creat a new table.

```
ain@raspberrypi:~ $ sqlite3 sensordata.db  
SQLite version 3.40.1 2022-12-28 14:03:47  
Enter ".help" for usage hints.  
sqlite> BEGIN;  
sqlite> CREATE TABLE dhtreadings (  
   ...> id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  
   ...> temperature NUMERIC,  
   ...> humidity NUMERIC,  
   ...> currentdate DATE,  
   ...> currenttime TIME,  
   ...> device TEXT  
   ...> );  
sqlite> COMMIT;
```

### Check the table

You can use the following command to view the created table.

```
sqlite> .tables  
dhtreadings  
sqlite> .fullschema  
CREATE TABLE dhtreadings (  
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  
  
temperature NUMERIC,  
humidity NUMERIC,  
currentdate DATE,  
currenttime TIME,  
device TEXT  
);  
/* No STAT tables available */
```

### SQL insert

To insert new temperature and humidity readings in the database, you could do something like this:

```
sqlite> BEGIN;  
sqlite> INSERT INTO dhtreadings(temperature, humidity, currentdate, currenttime, device) values(22.4, 48, date('now'), time('now'), "manual");  
sqlite> COMMIT;
```

### SQL select

To access the data stored in the database, you use the SELECT SQL statement:

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM dhtreadings;  
1|22.4|48|2025-09-26|01:23:37|manual
```

So far, you only have 1 reading inserted in the database. You can insert a new reading as follows:

```
sqlite> BEGIN;  
sqlite> INSERT INTO dhtreadings(temperature, humidity, currentdate, currenttime, device) values(22.5, 48.7, date('now'), time('now'), "manual");  
sqlite> COMMIT;
```

And when you SELECT the data stored in the table, it returns 2 readings:

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM dhtreadings;  
1|22.4|48|2025-09-26|01:23:37|manual  
2|22.5|48.7|2025-09-26|02:06:35|manual
```

### SQL drop

If you want to completely delete the table from your database, you can use the DROP TABLE command.

> NOTE: the next command will completely delete the dhtreadings table:

```
sqlite> DROP TABLE dhtreadings;
```

Now, if you type the ‘.tables‘ command:

```
sqlite> .tables
```

It doesn’t return anything, because your table was completely deleted.

### Use Python with SQLite

Using Python to interact with SQLite like below:

test\_sqlite.py

```
import sqlite3  
from datetime import datetime  
import os  
  
def create_connection(db_file="dht_readings.db"):  
    """Create a database connection to the SQLite database"""  
    conn = None  
    try:  
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)  
        print(f"Connected to SQLite database: {db_file}")  
    except sqlite3.Error as e:  
        print(f"Error connecting to database: {e}")  
    return conn  
  
def create_table(conn):  
    """Create the dhtreadings table if it doesn't exist"""  
    try:  
        sql_create_dhtreadings_table = """  
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dhtreadings (  
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

            humidity REAL NOT NULL,  
            currentdate TEXT NOT NULL,  
            currenttime TEXT NOT NULL,  
            device TEXT NOT NULL  
        );  
        """  
        conn.cursor().execute(sql_create_dhtreadings_table)  
        conn.commit()  
        print("DHT readings table created successfully")  
    except sqlite3.Error as e:  
        print(f"Error creating table: {e}")  
  
def insert_dht_reading(conn, temperature, humidity, device):  
    """Insert a new DHT reading into the dhtreadings table"""  
    sql_insert = """INSERT INTO dhtreadings(temperature, humidity, currentdate, currenttime, device)   
                    VALUES(?, ?, date('now'), time('now'), ?);"""  
    try:  
        cursor = conn.cursor()  
        cursor.execute(sql_insert, (temperature, humidity, device))  
        conn.commit()  
        print(f"New record created successfully with ID: {cursor.lastrowid}")  
        return cursor.lastrowid  
    except sqlite3.Error as e:  
        print(f"Error inserting data: {e}")  
        return None  
  
def select_all_readings(conn):  
    """Query all DHT readings in the dhtreadings table"""  
    try:  
        cursor = conn.cursor()  
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM dhtreadings ORDER BY currentdate DESC, currenttime DESC")  
          
        rows = cursor.fetchall()  
        print("\nAll DHT readings:")  
        print("ID | Temperature | Humidity | Date | Time | Device")  
        print("-" * 60)  
        for row in rows:  
            print(f"{row[0]} | {row[1]} | {row[2]} | {row[3]} | {row[4]} | {row[5]}")  
    except sqlite3.Error as e:  
        print(f"Error fetching data: {e}")  
  
def main():  
    # Create a database connection  
    database = "dht_readings.db"  
    conn = create_connection(database)  
      
    # Create table  
    if conn is not None:  
        create_table(conn)  
          
        # Insert a sample reading as specified in your requirement  
        insert_dht_reading(conn, 22.5, 48.7, "manual")  
          
        # Insert some additional sample data for testing  
        insert_dht_reading(conn, 23.1, 45.2, "sensor1")  
        insert_dht_reading(conn, 21.8, 50.3, "sensor2")  
          
        # Display all readings  
        select_all_readings(conn)  
          
        # Close the connection  
        conn.close()  
        print("\nDatabase connection closed.")  
    else:  
        print("Error! Cannot create database connection.")  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    main()
