![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/5g_c.jpg)

### Usage Instruction

**Step 1.** Check Hardware Recognition

```
lsusb
```

This command displays a list of all USB devices connected to the system, along with their manufacturer (ID), type, and other information. For example, the output might show a device from Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. EM12-G, indicating that the 5G module is present.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/lsusb.png)

**Step 2.** Confirm Driver Loading
It's essential to ensure that the option driver, which is required for the 5G module, is loaded. We can use the lsmod command to check.

```
lsmod | grep option
```

If the option driver is loaded successfully, relevant information about the driver will be displayed in the output.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/lsmod.png)

**Step 3.** Configure ModemManager
ModemManager is a tool for managing modem devices, and it needs to be installed and restarted.

```
sudo apt install modemmanager   
sudo systemctl restart ModemManager
```

The apt install command is used to install the ModemManager package, while systemctl restart restarts the ModemManager service to ensure that the new settings take effect.

**Step 4.** Verify Module Identification
We can use the mmcli -L command to check if the ModemManager can correctly identify the 5G module.

```
mmcli -L
```

If the 5G module is recognized, an output similar to /org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modem/0 will be displayed, indicating the path to the detected modem device.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/nmcli_l.jpg)

**Step 5.** Set the APN
APN (Access Point Name) is crucial for connecting a mobile device to the network.We'll use the nmcli command to create a bearer profile. Taking China Mobile as an example, we can create a configuration file with the following commands:

```
sudo nmcli con add type gsm ifname "*" apn "CMNET" ipv4.method  auto
```

This command adds a new GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) type connection, specifying the APN as "CMNET" and using automatic IPv4 configuration.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/nmcli_con.jpg)

**Step 6.** Activate the Connection
After creating the bearer profile, we need to activate the connection.

```
sudo nmcli con up "gsm"
```

This command activates the GSM connection, and if successful, a confirmation message will be displayed.

**Step 7.** Re-verify Module Identification
Run the mmcli -L command again to ensure that the module remains recognized after configuring the APN.

```
mmcli -L
```

**Step 8.** Check Module Status
Finally, we can use the mmcli -m 0 command to view detailed information about the module, such as IP allocation, carrier, and network connection status.

```
mmcli -m 0
```

This command provides comprehensive details about the 5G module, including its manufacturer, model, supported and current network technologies, device status, and connected network operators.

The Robotics J401 provides one CAN0 interface integrated into the XT30 (2+2) power connector for convenient power and data transmission.Additionally, offers 3 CAN1 interface via two standard JST 4-pin headers for flexible CAN bus connectivity.

### CAN Communication

In the [datasheet](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/NVIDIA-Jetson/reComputer_robotics_J401_datasheet.pdf), you can find the wiring diagram for the CAN0/CAN1 interface as shown below:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can1_datasheet.png)

Here we will demonstrate to you how to conduct data communication using the CAN1 interface, by utilizing the [USB to CAN Analyzer Adapter](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-CAN-Analyzer-p-2888.html).

### Hardware Connection

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can1_c.png)

According to the connection method shown in the figure below, connect CAN1's CANL, CANH, and GND to the corresponding CANL, CANH, and GND ports of the USB to CAN tool respectively.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can1_c1.png)

In our case, according to the adapter that we used, we have downloaded and installed the software which can be found [here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/USB-CAN-Analyzer/tree/master/res/Program).

**Step 1.** Configure the CAN1 interface:

```
#Set the bit rate  
sudo ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000  
#Enable CAN1  
sudo ip link set can1 up
```

**Step 2.** Configure the PC data receiving software.
Please configure the communication settings as shown in the following picture.

cansend can1 123#abcdabcd
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/pc_rcan1.png)

**Step 3.** PC sends data to the Jetson:

```
#CAN1 monitors PC data  
candump can1
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can1.png)

It can be seen that the Jetson terminal has received the data sent by the PC.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can1_r.png)

### CAN FD Mode

Here, I use CAN0 to connect to CAN1 to demonstrate how multiple Jetson devices can communicate via the CAN interface.

### Hardware Connection

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/can0_can1_c.jpg)

**Step 1.** Remove the bottom cover and set both 120Ω termination resistors to the ​ON position.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/on.jpg)

**Step 2.** Configure CAN0 and CAN1 interfaces:

```
#close the interface  
  
sudo ip link set can0 down  
sudo ip link set can1 down  
  
#Set to FD mode  
  
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 2000000 fd on  
sudo ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 2000000 fd on  
  
#open the interface  
sudo ip link set can0 up  
sudo ip link set can1 up
```

**Step 3.** Open a new terminal to listen to CAN1 and via CAN0 send data to CAN1:

```
#open a new terminal and run  
candump can1  
  
#another terminal sends data  
cansend can0 123##011112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
```

  Wire.onReceive(receiveEvent);  
  Wire.onRequest(requestEvent);  
}  
  
void loop() {  
  delay(100);  
}  
  
void receiveEvent(int howMany) {  
  // Callback when receiving host data  
  while (Wire.available()) {  
    char c = Wire.read();  
    // Data received can be processed here.  
  }  
}  
  
void requestEvent() {  
  // Callback when the host requests data  
  Wire.write("A"); // Return a byte of data  
}
```

**Step 4.** Jetson install the tools for IIC testing.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/robotics_j401/g_camera.png)

### Use the cameras of SGxxx Series

**step 1.** Set frame synchronization mode(It is not enabled by default!).

info

Here we demonstrate how to configure cameras of different models and resolutions.

```
#enables frame synchronization  
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=trig_mode=1  
#Set the frame rate of the camera  
v4l2-ctl -V --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1536 -c sensor_mode=0 --stream-mmap -d /dev/video0  
#Set the camera format  
v4l2-ctl -V --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1536 -c sensor_mode=0 -d /dev/video0
```

note

`trig_mode = 1` enables frame synchronization, while `trig_mode = 0` disables frame synchronization. The default setting is to disable frame synchronization.

`--set-fmt-video` follows the resolution which is selected based on the camera being connected. Currently, there are three sensor\_mode options, each corresponding to a different resolution.

* sensor\_mode=0 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/1920x1536
* sensor\_mode=1 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/1920x1080
* sensor\_mode=2 -------> YUYV8\_1X16/3840x2160

**step 2.** Start the camera.

```
