# Distributed llama.cpp on reComputer Jetson (RPC Mode)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/recomputer_robotic_j501/hardware_overview.png.jpg)

Running large language models (LLMs) on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson can be challenging due to memory and compute constraints. This guide demonstrates how to distribute LLM inference across multiple reComputer Jetson devices using llama.cpp's RPC backend, enabling horizontal scaling for more demanding workloads.

## Prerequisites

* Two reComputer Jetson devices with JetPack 6.x+ installed and CUDA drivers working properly
* Both devices on the same local network, able to `ping` each other
* Local machine (client) with ≥ 64 GB RAM, remote node with ≥ 32 GB RAM

## 1. Clone Source Code

**Step 1.** Clone the llama.cpp repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git   
cd llama.cpp
```

## 2. Install Build Dependencies

**Step 1.** Update package list and install required dependencies:

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev python3-pip
```

## 3. Build with RPC + CUDA Backend

**Step 1.** Configure CMake with RPC and CUDA support:

```
cmake -B build \  
  -DGGML_CUDA=ON \  
  -DGGML_RPC=ON \  
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

**Step 2.** Compile with parallel jobs:

```
cmake --build build --parallel   # Multi-core parallel compilation
```

## 4. Install Python Conversion Tools

**Step 1.** Install the Python package in development mode:

```
pip3 install -e .
```

## 5. Download and Convert Model

This example uses TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0:

Model link:
<https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0>

Download these files and place them in a self-created TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 folder.

**Step 1.** Convert the Hugging Face model to GGUF format:

```
# Assuming the model is already downloaded to ~/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 using git-lfs or huggingface-cli  
python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py \  
  --outfile ~/TinyLlama-1.1B.gguf \  
  ~/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
```

## 6. Verify Single-Machine Inference

**Step 1.** Test the model with a simple prompt:

```
./build/bin/llama-cli \  
  -m ~/TinyLlama-1.1B.gguf \  
  -p "Hello, how are you today?" \  
  -n 64
```

If you receive a response, the model is working correctly.

## 7. Distributed RPC Operation

### 7.1 Hardware Topology Example

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Device RAM Role IP|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Machine A 64 GB Client + Local Server 192.168.100.2|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Machine B 32 GB Remote Server 192.168.100.1 | | | | | | | | | | | |

### 7.2 Start Remote RPC Server (Machine B)")

**Step 1.** Connect to the remote machine and start the RPC server:

```
ssh [email protected]  
cd ~/llama.cpp  
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build/bin/rpc-server --host 192.168.100.1
```

The server defaults to port `50052`. To customize, add `-p <port>`.

### 7.3 Start Local RPC Server (Machine A)")

**Step 1.** Start the local RPC server:

```
cd ~/llama.cpp  
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build/bin/rpc-server -p 50052
```

### 7.4 Joint Inference (Multi-node Load)")

**Step 1.** Run inference using both local and remote RPC servers:

```
./build/bin/llama-cli \  
  -m ~/TinyLlama-1.1B.gguf \  
  -p "Hello, my name is" \  
  -n 64 \  
  --rpc 192.168.100.1:50052,127.0.0.1:50052 \  
  -ngl 99
```

`-ngl 99` offloads 99% of layers to GPUs (both RPC nodes and local GPU).

note

If you want to run locally only, remove the remote address from `--rpc`:
`--rpc 127.0.0.1:50052`

## 8. Performance Comparison

*Left: GPU utilization on 192.168.100.1; Right: GPU utilization on 192.168.100.2*

*When running locally only, GPU pressure is concentrated on a single card*

## 9. Troubleshooting

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Issue Solution|  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | rpc-server startup failure Check if port is occupied or firewall is blocking 50052/tcp|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Slower inference speed Model too small, network latency > computation benefit; try larger model or Unix-socket mode|  |  | | --- | --- | | Out of memory error Reduce `-ngl` value to offload fewer layers to GPU, or keep some layers on CPU | | | | | | | |

With this setup, you can now achieve "horizontal scaling" for LLM inference across multiple Jetson devices using llama.cpp's RPC backend. For higher throughput, you can add more RPC nodes or further quantize the model to formats like `q4_0` or `q5_k_m`.
