# Building a Voice-Interactive Chatbot with Local LLMs, STT, and TTS

This project brings the dream of a **fully voice-interactive AI assistant** to life — running entirely **on local hardware**, without reliance on cloud services.  
By combining **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, and **Local Large Language Models (LLMs)** using **Ollama**, the system enables natural, private, and real-time conversations between humans and machines.

The entire setup runs inside Docker containers and can be deployed on **NVIDIA Jetson devices**, **edge computers**, or any Linux-based system with GPU acceleration.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **voice-driven chatbot** capable of:

* Listening to your voice in real time.
* Understanding your speech using local **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**.
* Generating intelligent responses using a **local LLM**.
* Speaking those responses naturally using **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**.

All components are self-contained and run locally, giving you full control over your data — no cloud dependencies, no latency, no privacy concerns.

---

## System Components

### 1. Speech-to-Text (STT) Module Module")

Transforms your spoken input into text in real time.  
Key features:

* Fast, accurate transcription using **NVIDIA Riva ASR**.
* Support for multiple languages.
* Optimized for edge devices.

### 2. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Module Module")

Converts chatbot responses into natural-sounding voice output.  
Highlights:

* Multilingual, expressive, and realistic speech synthesis.
* Powered by **NVIDIA Riva TTS**.
* Low latency — perfect for interactive conversations.

### 3. Local LLM (Ollama)")

At the heart of the chatbot is **Ollama**, a local inference engine for running modern LLMs efficiently.  
Features:

* Offline operation (no internet needed).
* Real-time responses even on Jetson devices.
* Context retention for smooth, coherent dialogue.
* Supports various models including Llama, Phi, Gemma, Mistral, and more.

### 4. User Interaction Layer

A simple, intuitive interface allows users to:

* Start or stop voice interaction via buttons or commands.
* See live transcriptions and chatbot responses.
* Enjoy smooth, low-latency communication from voice to voice.

## Setting Up Ollama Locally

We’ll start by installing [Jetson Containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers) to easily manage and deploy our services inside Docker.

```
# Install Jetson Container tools  
git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers  
bash jetson-containers/install.sh
```

Once installed, pull and run the **Ollama** container:

```
jetson-containers run --name ollama $(autotag ollama)  
ollama run llama3.2:1b
```

💡 **Tip:** Start with smaller models (like `llama3.2:1b`) to test your configuration, then scale up.

Available models on [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library):

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model Parameters Size Command|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Llama 3.2 3B 2.0 GB `ollama run llama3.2`| Llama 3.2 1B 1.3 GB `ollama run llama3.2:1b`| Llama 3.2 Vision 11B 7.9 GB `ollama run llama3.2-vision`| Phi 3 Mini 3.8B 2.3 GB `ollama run phi3`| Gemma 2 9B 5.5 GB `ollama run gemma2`| Mistral 7B 4.1 GB `ollama run mistral` | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

If you’re using an **NVIDIA Jetson AGX**, you can comfortably run medium to large models. For smaller Jetsons, stick with lightweight models (1B–3B).

Run Ollama either directly in terminal or through the provided Python script `ollama_run.py`.

```
python3 ollama_run.py
```

## NVIDIA Riva: STT and TTS

To enable real voice interaction, we use **NVIDIA Riva**, a GPU-accelerated toolkit that provides:

* **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
* **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** (optional)

It can be deployed anywhere — from the cloud to embedded devices like the **Jetson series**.

### Step 1: Get Your NGC API Key

1. Log in to [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/).
2. Create an **API key** and save it locally — you’ll need it to access Riva resources.

### Step 2: Configure NGC on Jetson

```
cd ~ && mkdir ngc_setup && cd ngc_setup  
wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/resources/nvidia/ngc-apps/ngc_cli/versions/3.36.0/files/ngccli_arm64.zip  
unzip ngccli_arm64.zip   
chmod u+x ngc-cli/ngc  
echo "export PATH=\"$PATH:$(pwd)/ngc-cli\"" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile  
ngc config set
```

Use your API key when prompted.

### Step 3: Install Riva on Jetson

Ensure you’re running **JetPack 6.0** (or check compatibility in the [Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/support-matrix.html)).

```
cd ~ && mkdir riva_setup && cd riva_setup  
ngc registry resource download-version nvidia/riva/riva_quickstart_arm64:2.16.0  
cd riva_quickstart_v2.13.1
```

In `config.sh`, disable unused services to save resources:

```
service_enabled_nlp=false  
service_enabled_nmt=false
```

Then configure Docker to use the NVIDIA runtime by editing `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```
{  
  "default-runtime": "nvidia",  
  "runtimes": {  
    "nvidia": {  
      "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",  
      "runtimeArgs": []  
    }  
  }  
}
```

Restart Docker:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Finally, initialize and start Riva:

```
sudo bash riva_init.sh  
sudo bash riva_start.sh
```

## Running the Chatbot

Once everything is ready, run the main application:

```
git clone https://github.com/kouroshkarimi/local_chatbot_jetson.git  
cd local_chatbot_jetson  
python3 app.py --list-input-devices  
python3 app.py --list-output-devices  
python3 app.py --input-device <your_input_id> --output-device <your_output_id>
```

You can now **speak to your assistant**, and it will **listen, think, and talk back** — all locally, powered by your Jetson.
