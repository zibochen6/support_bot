### 使用说明

简单的 GPIO 控制示例

```
#install  
sudo apt-get install gpiod  
  
# Search for the corresponding number for the pin  
sudo gpiofind PH.00  
gpiochip0 43  
  
#Set the pin to H, then press Enter to release.  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 43=1  
  
#Set the Pin to L, then press Enter to release.  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 43=0  
  
#gpio 0_119 Low level maintained for 2 seconds  
sudo gpioset --mode=time -s 2 0 119=0  
  
#input  
sudo gpioget 0 43
```

**如果您想配置默认未启用的 GPIO，请参考以下步骤：**

启用 40 针接头：

```
  sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py
```

保存并重启。

**通过 Overlay 配置来配置未受控制的 GPIO：**

**步骤 1.** 下载并解压 [overlay 包](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/overlay.zip) 到您的 jetson 设备。

```
wget https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/overlay.zip
```

**步骤 2.** 将 build.sh 和 gpio-overlay.dts 复制到 Jetson。

**步骤 3.** 编辑 `pio-overlay.dts` 文件并修改它以包含您需要的引脚的 pinmux 定义。

info

更多详细信息请参见 [jetson-orin-nx-and-orin-nano-series-pinmux-config](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/jetson-orin-nx-and-orin-nano-series-pinmux-config-template)

**步骤 3.** 启用覆盖配置。

```
sudo bash ./build.sh  
#The following command needs to be executed only once.  
sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/config-by-hardware.py -n "seeed gpio config Overlay"
```

**步骤 4.** 重启设备以使配置生效。

```
sudo reboot
```

**步骤 5.** 现在您可以通过 `gpioset` 控制刚刚修改的引脚。

```
#For example px7  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 121=1
```

### 12 引脚控制和 UART 接头

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/12pin2.jpg)

12 引脚控制和 UART 接头提供了用于连接和管理外部设备的基本控制信号和 UART 通信接口。

note

reComputer Super 的引脚功能与 reComputer Classic 类似。更多详细信息，请参考[这里](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/cn/J401_carrierboard_Hardware_Interfaces_Usage/#gpio)。

## HDMI

reComputer Super 配备了 HDMI 2.1 Type A 端口，支持 7680x4320 分辨率。这允许超高清视频输出。
