## RTC

The reComputer Super features RTC interfaces, providing accurate timekeeping even when the system is powered off.

### Hardware Connection

Connect a 3V CR1225 coin cell battery to the RTC socket on the board as shown below. Make sure the **positive (+)** end of the battery is facing upwards.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/rtc.jpg)

### Usage Instruction

**Step1.** Connect an RTC battery as mentioned above.

**Step2.** Turn on reComputer Super.

**Step3.** On the Ubuntu Desktop, click the drop-down menu at the top right corner, navigate to `Settings > Date & Time`, connect to a network via an Ethernet cable and select **Automatic Date & Time** to obtain the date/ time automatically.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Industrial/13.png)

note

If you have not connected to internet via Ethernet, you can manually set the date/ time here.

**Step4.** Open a terminal window, and execute the below command to check the hardware clock time:

```
cat /sys/devices/platform/bpmp/bpmp\:i2c/i2c-4/4-003c/nvvrs-pseq-rtc/rtc/rtc0/time
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/rtc_time1(1).png)

**Step5.** Disconnect the network connection and reboot the device. You will find that the system time has lost power but still functions normally.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/rtc_time2.png)

## Ethernet

There are 2 RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet on reComputer Super supported 10/100/1000M. ETH0 is the native Ethernet port, and the other one ETH1 is converted from PCIe.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/eth.jpg)

There are 2 LEDs (green and yellow) on each Ethernet port:

* Green LED: ON only when connected to 1000M/10G network.
* Yellow LED: Shows the network activity status.

Test the Ethernet speed:

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.254.100 -R
```

info

-c `<ip address>` is the server IP address, and -R means reverse mode.

note

For more information, please check [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.4.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/PlatformPowerAndPerformance/JetsonOrinNanoSeriesJetsonOrinNxSeriesAndJetsonAgxOrinSeries.html?highlight=fan#fan-profile-control).

**Set fan speed:**

```
sudo -i  
echo 100 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1
```

Additionally, we can manually set the fan speed using the jtop tool.

## CAN

The reComputer Super series provides a CAN interface where the CAN signal is output directly from the SOM at TTL/CMOS levels, which is a non-standard differential signal requiring an external CAN transceiver to connect to a standard CAN bus; it supports CAN FD frame formats, allowing extended data length and higher data rates, making it suitable for industrial automation, robotics, automotive prototyping, and other applications requiring reliable, real-time communication.

### Hardware Connection

Please note the sequence of the connected lines (R OUT ↔ RX, D IN ↔ TX), and then convert them to CAN\_L and CAN\_H through the CAN bus transceiver.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/can1.png)

According to the [Datasheet of reComputer Super](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/NVIDIA-Jetson/reComputer_super_user_manual.pdf), connect the CAN heater to the CAN bus transceiver in the corresponding manner, then connect the CAN bus transceiver to the [USB to CAN Analyzer Adapter](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-CAN-Analyzer-p-2888.html), and finally connect it to the Jetson for loopback communication testing.

### Usage Instruction

Simple GPIO control example

```
#install  
sudo apt-get install gpiod  
  
# Search for the corresponding number for the pin  
sudo gpiofind PH.00  
gpiochip0 43  
  
#Set the pin to H, then press Enter to release.  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 43=1  
  
#Set the Pin to L, then press Enter to release.  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 43=0  
  
#gpio 0_119 Low level maintained for 2 seconds  
sudo gpioset --mode=time -s 2 0 119=0  
  
#input  
sudo gpioget 0 43
```

**If you want to configure the GPIO that is not enabled by default, please refer to the following steps:**

Enable 40-Pin Header:

```
  sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py
```

Save and reboot.

**Configure the uncontrolled GPIO through the Overlay configuration:**

**Step 1.** Download and extract the [overlay package](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/overlay.zip) to your jetson device.

```
wget https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/overlay.zip
```

**Step 2.** Copy build.sh and gpio-overlay.dts to Jetson.

**Step 3.** Edit the `pio-overlay.dts` file and modify it to include the pinmux definitions for the pins you need.

info

more details you can see in [jetson-orin-nx-and-orin-nano-series-pinmux-config](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/jetson-orin-nx-and-orin-nano-series-pinmux-config-template)

**Step 3.** Enable overlay configuration.

```
sudo bash ./build.sh  
#The following command needs to be executed only once.  
sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/config-by-hardware.py -n "seeed gpio config Overlay"
```

**Step 4.** Reboot the device enables the configuration to take effect.

```
sudo reboot
```

**Step 5.** Now you can control the pins by `gpioset` that were just modified.

```
#For example px7  
sudo gpioset --mode=wait 0 121=1
```

### 12-Pin Control and UART Header

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/reComputer-super/12pin2.jpg)

The 12-Pin Control and UART Header provides essential control signals and UART communication interfaces for connecting and managing external devices.

note

The pin functions of reComputer Super are similar to those of reComputer Classic. For more detailed information, please refer to [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/J401_carrierboard_Hardware_Interfaces_Usage/#gpio).

## HDMI

reComputer Super is equipped with an HDMI 2.1 Type A port, which supports a resolution of 7680x4320. This allows for ultra-high-definition video output.
