![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/camera-connect-J401.gif)

### 使用方法

打开您的终端（Ctrl+Alt+T）并输入如下命令：

```
sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-cameral.gif)

* 方法 1* Method 2

对于 CAM0 端口

```
nvgstcapture-1.0 sensor-id=0
```

For CAM1 port

```
nvgstcapture-1.0 sensor-id=1
```

note

如果您想进一步更改相机的设置，可以输入 **"nvgstcapture-1.0 --help"** 来访问所有可用的可配置选项。

对于 CAM0 端口

```
gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc sensor-id=0 sensor-mode=0 ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1920, height=1080, framerate=20/1, format=NV12' ! nvvidconv ! xvimagesink
```

For CAM1 port

```
gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc sensor-id=1 sensor-mode=0 ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1920, height=1080, framerate=20/1, format=NV12' ! nvvidconv ! xvimagesink
```

note

如果您想进一步更改相机设置，可以更新参数，如 **width、height、framerate、format** 等。

## RTC

RTC 代表实时时钟。它是一个独立于主系统时钟跟踪当前时间和日期的时钟。RTC 通常用于计算机、嵌入式系统和其他电子设备中，即使在设备断电时也能保持准确的计时。它们通常由小电池供电，以确保连续运行并在电源循环期间保留时间和日期信息。

### 连接概述

* 方法 1* 方法 2

将 **3V CR1220 纽扣电池** 连接到板上的 RTC 插座，如下所示。确保电池的 **正极 (+)** 端朝上。

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-connect-coin-cell-back.gif)

将 **带 JST 连接器的 3V CR2302 纽扣电池** 连接到板上的 2 针 1.25mm JST 插座，如下所示：

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-connect-coin-cell.gif)

### 使用方法

* **步骤 1：** 按照上述方法连接 RTC 电池。
* **步骤 2：** 打开 reComputer Industrial。
* **步骤 3：** 在 Ubuntu 桌面上，点击右上角的下拉菜单，导航到 `Settings > Date & Time`，通过以太网电缆连接到网络并选择 **Automatic Date & Time** 以自动获取日期/时间。

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Industrial/13.png)

note

如果您没有通过以太网连接到互联网，可以在此处手动设置日期/时间。

* **步骤 4：** 打开终端窗口，执行以下命令检查硬件时钟时间。

```
sudo hwclock
```

您将看到如下所示的输出，这不是正确的日期/时间。

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-RTC.png)

* **步骤 5：** 通过输入以下命令将硬件时钟时间更改为当前系统时钟时间。

```
sudo hwclock --systohc
```

* **步骤 6：** 移除任何连接的以太网电缆，确保它不会从互联网获取时间，然后重启开发板。

```
sudo reboot
```

* **步骤 7：** 检查硬件时钟时间，以验证即使设备断电，日期/时间也保持不变。
* **步骤 8：** 使用您偏好的任何文本编辑器创建一个新的 shell 脚本。这里我们使用 **vi** 文本编辑器。

```
sudo vi /usr/bin/hwtosys.sh
```

* **步骤 9:** 按下 **i** 进入**插入模式**，复制并粘贴以下内容到文件中。

```
#!/bin/bash  
  
sudo hwclock --hctosys
```

* **步骤 10:** 使脚本可执行。

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/hwtosys.sh
```

* **步骤 11：** 创建一个 systemd 文件。

```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/hwtosys.service
```

* **步骤 12:** 在文件内添加以下内容。

```
[Unit]  
Description=Change system clock from hardware clock  
  
[Service]  
ExecStart=/usr/bin/hwtosys.sh  
  
[Install]  
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* **步骤 13：** 重新加载 systemctl 守护进程。

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

* **步骤 14:** 启用新创建的服务在系统启动时自动启动，并立即启动该服务。

```
sudo systemctl enable hwtosys.service  
sudo systemctl start hwtosys.service
```

* **步骤 15:** 验证脚本作为 systemd 服务正在运行。

```
sudo systemctl status hwtosys.service
```

* **步骤 16：** 重启开发板，您将看到系统时钟现在与硬件时钟同步。

## 风扇控制

nvfancontrol 是一个用户空间风扇转速控制守护进程。它基于 nvfancontrol 配置文件中的温度到风扇转速映射表来管理风扇转速。

nvfancontrol 服务中有一些基本元素，包括 Tmargin、启动 PWM、风扇配置文件、风扇控制和风扇调节器。所有这些都可以根据用户的偏好通过配置文件进行编程。本章将在以下部分中解释每一个元素。

note

如果您想要更改 nvfancontrol.conf，请确保您已经阅读了[它](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.4.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/PlatformPowerAndPerformance/JetsonOrinNanoSeriesJetsonOrinNxSeriesAndJetsonAgxOrinSeries.html?highlight=fan#fan-profile-control)

### 使用方法

* Method 1* Method 2

* **步骤 1：** 停止 nvfancontrol systemd 服务。

```
sudo systemctl stop nvfancontrol
```

* **步骤 2：** 修改 nvfancontrol.conf。

```
vi /etc/nvfancontrol.conf
```

note

更改 nvfancontrol.conf 后，输入 `Ese` 和 `:q` 退出

* **步骤 3:** 删除状态文件。

```
sudo rm /var/lib/nvfancontrol/status
```

* **步骤 4:** 重启 nvfancontrol systemd 服务。

```
sudo systemctl restart nvfancontrol
```

* **步骤 1：** 进入 root 模式。

```
sudo -i
```

* **步骤 2:** 停止 nvfancontrol systemd 服务。

```
sudo systemctl stop nvfancontrol
```

* **步骤 3：** 修改 PWM 值。

```
echo 100 > /sys/devices/platform/pwm-fan/hwmon/hwmon3/pwm1
```

note

数值越大，风扇转速越快。PWM 值应在 0 到 255 之间，可能 **hwmon3** 不是您的路径，请检查您自己的路径

* **步骤 4：** 检查转速。

```
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/rpm
```

### UART

UART 代表通用异步收发器。它是一种用于两个设备之间串行通信的通信协议。UART 通信涉及两个引脚：一个用于发送数据（TX），一个用于接收数据（RX）。它是异步的，意味着数据传输时设备之间不需要共享时钟信号。UART 常用于各种应用，如微控制器、传感器以及不同电子设备之间的通信。

#### 连接概述

UART 接口使用下面的引脚，或者您可以在 J401 上使用另一个 UART 接口：

#### 使用方法

* **步骤 1：** 在您的 Windows 笔记本电脑上安装 [PuTTy](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)，并按如下设置 PuTTy：

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/A608/J401-windows-uart-set.png)

* **步骤 2：** 在 Jetson 上安装 PuTTy，打开您的终端（ALT+Ctrl+T）并输入以下命令。

```
sudo apt install putty
```

* **步骤 3：** 在 Windows 上使用 PuTTy 向 Jetson 发送 'hello linux'，在 Jetson 上使用 PuTTy 向 Windows 发送 'hello windows'。

note

确保您的波特率已设置为 115200。

结果如下所示：

### I2C

I2C 代表集成电路间通信。它是一种广泛使用的串行通信协议，能够在系统中的多个集成电路之间进行通信。I2C 使用两条双向线路：一条用于数据（SDA），一条用于时钟（SCL）。连接在 I2C 总线上的设备可以充当主设备或从设备，允许多个设备相互通信。I2C 因其简单性、灵活性以及能够在嵌入式系统和电子设备中连接各种设备（如传感器、存储芯片和其他外设）而广受欢迎。

#### 连接概述

I2C 接口使用如下引脚，或者您可以在 J401 上使用其他 I2C 接口：

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

将 J401 连接到 [Grove-3-Axis Digital Accelerometer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-3-Axis-Digital-Accelerometer-1-5g.html)，使用 I2C 连接如下：

#### 测试

打开您的终端（ALT+Ctrl+T）并输入以下命令：

```
i2cdetect -y -r 7
```

note

在命令 `i2cdetect -y -r x` 中，您的通道可能与我的不同。

您将看到如下结果，在连接到 I2C 之前，通道 7 上没有检测到 I2C 设备，但之后检测到了地址为 0x19 的 I2C 设备：
