## Introduction

reComputer J1010 is a compact edge computer built with NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB production module, comes with 128 NVIDIA CUDA® cores deliver 0.5 TFLOPs (FP16) to run AI frameworks and applications like image classification, object detection, and speech processing. The production modules offers 16GB eMMC, a longer warranty, and 5-10 year operating life in a production environment([Jetson FAQ](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/faq)). We also have reComputer [J20 series](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J2021-p-5438.html?queryID=14111cbf2ca4f2951fd8a4c1762eb435&objectID=5438&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products) built with a Jetson Xavier NX module, delivering 21 TOPS AI performance for more complex AI workloads.

Besides the Jetson module, reComputer J1010 also includes [J101 carrier board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J101-v2-Carrier-Board-for-Jetson-Nano-p-5396.html) with onboard microSD card slot, 1×USB 3.0, 2×USB2.0, HDMI, M.2 Key E for WiFI, LTE and Bluetooth, RTC, Raspberry Pi GPIO 40-pin, and so on, as well as a heatsink, and aluminum case. The device has been pre-installed Jetpack 4.6.1, just plug in a USB C 5V/3A power supply, keyboard, mouse, and ethernet cable, you are ready to start your embedded AI journey! If you need more USB 3.0 and onboard M.2 key M for attaching SSD, you can choose reComputer J1020.

Note: We received customer inquiries they need more storage than 16GB eMMC offered. For orders after July 30th, 2022, we have included the microSD card slot on the [carrier board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J101-v2-Carrier-Board-for-Jetson-Nano-p-5396.html) of reComputer J1010. Please check the [guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/J1010_Boot_From_SD_Card/#flashing-system-from-j101-to-sd-card) on boot image to microSD card and adjust I/O speed.
