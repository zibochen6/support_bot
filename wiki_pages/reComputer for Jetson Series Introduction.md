## Interface Details

The current 4 reComputer products have the same appearance, the difference lies in the interface on the back. [reComputer J1010](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-A0-p-5336.html) uses one interface combination, and the other three use the same other interface combination because there are two different carrier boards used in the chassis.

### J1010 carrier board

This carrier board is suitable for [reComputer J1010](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-A0-p-5336.html).
