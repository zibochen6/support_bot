danger

Jetpack6 镜像文件大小约为 **16.7GB**，下载时间约为 60 分钟。请耐心等待下载完成。

info

为了验证下载固件的完整性，您可以比较 SHA256 哈希值。

在 Ubuntu 主机上，打开终端并运行命令 `sha256sum <File>` 来获取下载文件的 SHA256 哈希值。如果得到的哈希值与 wiki 中提供的 SHA256 哈希值匹配，则确认您下载的固件是完整无损的。

### 进入强制恢复模式

info

在进行安装步骤之前，我们需要确保开发板处于强制恢复模式。

 分步指南 

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/mini/reComputer_mini_rec.png)

* **步骤 1.** 在 USB2.0 DEVICE 端口和 ubuntu 主机 PC 之间连接一根 USB Micro-B 线缆。
* **步骤 2.** 使用针插入 RECOVERY 孔按下恢复按钮并保持按住。
* **步骤 3.** 连接电源。
* **步骤 4.** 释放恢复按钮。

在 Linux 主机 PC 上，打开终端窗口并输入命令 `lsusb`。如果返回的内容根据您使用的 Jetson SoM 有以下输出之一，则开发板处于强制恢复模式。

* 对于 Orin NX 16GB：0955:7323 NVidia Corp
* 对于 Orin NX 8GB：0955:7423 NVidia Corp
* 对于 Orin Nano 8GB：0955:7523 NVidia Corp
* 对于 Orin Nano 4GB：0955:7623 NVidia Corp

下图是 Orin Nx 16GB 的示例：

### 逐步刷写到 Jetson

**步骤 1：** 在 ubuntu 主机 PC 上解压下载的镜像文件：

```
cd <path-to-image>  
sudo tar xpf mfi_xxxx.tar.gz  
# For example: sudo tar xpf mfi_recomputer-orin-nano-8g-j401-6.0-36.3.0-2024-06-07.tar.gz
```

**步骤 2：** 执行以下命令将 jetpack 系统刷写到 NVMe SSD：

```
cd mfi_xxxx  
# For example: cd mfi_recomputer-orin-j401  
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh --flash-only --massflash 1 --network usb0  --showlogs
```

如果刷写过程成功，您将看到以下输出

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-J4012/4.png)

note

刷写命令可能需要运行 2-10 分钟。

**步骤 3：** 使用开发板上的 **USB Type-C with DisplayPort** 将 J401 连接到显示器，并完成初始配置设置：

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/J401/jetpack6_configuration.png)

info

请根据您的需要完成 **System Configuration**。

**步骤 4（可选）：** 安装 Nvidia Jetpack SDK

请在 Jetson 设备上打开终端并执行以下命令：

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install nvidia-jetpack
```
